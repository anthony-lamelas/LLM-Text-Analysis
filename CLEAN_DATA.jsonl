Beginning at the bow and moving sternwards, a hand-held laser was \nprojected through pre-drilled centerline holes in the cross sections, incrementally, until \nthe laser passed undisturbed through all 23 components to confirm proper alignment \n(Figure 10). Additionally, circumference dimensions were compiled from \nDELFTship\u2122 for each cross-sectional location along the form, measurements were then \ntaken and compared to the values from the computer-generated model to guarantee \naccuracy. Plywood strips were nailed to the exterior curved surface of the cross-sections \nuntil the hull was covered with an external shell. By switching the wood-strip \nfabrication method from CNC milling to the use of a table saw, the team was able to \nminimize waste by 50% and eliminate the $300 cost of fabrication.  \nOnce all of the wood-strips were installed, Bondo\u00ae, an automotive body filler, was applied to remove any \nlow points and gaps. The automotive filler and wood-strips were then sanded extensively to create an even surface \nwhich matched the required specifications for the design of the hull. After the application of Bondo\u00ae, the form \nwas coated with an epoxy resin to create an impermeable finish and reduce bonding between the form and the \ncasted canoe. Prior to placing concrete, team members glued interior inlays, cut from 1/16th in. thick shelf liner, \nonto the form to create depressions in the canoe which would later be filled with concrete. Foam end pieces were \nattached to the form at the bow and stern ends to accurately replicate the fine edges of the canoe at those points.  \nTwo new QC methods were tested during troweling \npractice sessions that were held prior to casting days. Modified \nQC pins was designed to leave different sized imprints on the \nsurface of the concrete depending on the layer depth of the section \nbeing measured (Figure 11). Rubber strips were also placed along \nthe width of the canoe which allowed team members to trowel to \nthe correct 1/8th in. thickness designated for each layer. These new \nQC methods eliminated variability in the depth of concrete, \nresulting in consistent layer thickness. \nThis year\u2019s team utilized a larger mortar mixer with a \u00bd cubic-foot capacity, doubling the amount of \nconcrete that was produced per mix compared to previous years. The incorporation of this new mixer diminished \nthe net impact of batching errors, with any potential oversight having less of an effect on the concrete mixture \nthan with the smaller mix sizes that were employed previously. Increasing the capacity of the mixer also reduced \nthe possibility of producing cold joints along the canoe, with larger volumes of concrete being placed across fewer \nintervals, leading to greater uniformity within each layer.\nFigure 11: QC Pin Representation on Fresh Concrete \nFigure 10: Application of \nWooden Cross-Sections with \nLaser Guidance \nFigure 9: Lateral View of \nFinished Form \nCorrect \nDepth \nLayer is \ntoo Thin \nLayer is \ntoo Deep"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant that writes proposals for the ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "prompt": "Write the construction section for an ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "output": "7 \n The delay in concrete output on casting day was greatly \nreduced by pre-batching the material, which helped reduce the \noccurrence of delamination between the layers due to premature \nsetting. A designated team member was responsible for weighing \neach concrete mix prior to troweling and comparing it to the \ntheoretical weight of the mix as a final QC measure (Table 7). Based \non a risk assessment performed by the project managers, if a percent \ndifference of greater than 1% was found the mix would be discarded. \nA coat of olive oil, a sustainable form release agent, was \napplied prior to placement of the first layer of fresh concrete. Once \nmixed, the concrete was then placed initially in the female mold rib \nsections and then, from the bow and stern ends, was worked inward. A layer of Kevlar\u00ae woven mesh was stretched \ntaut, before application, to maximize its effects on tensile strength and placed along the assumed primary stress \ndirection between each layer of concrete (Figure 12). Following a traditionally reliable layering method, the \nresulting canoe composite was comprised of three layers of concrete and two layers of Kevlar\u00ae reinforcement to \nensure the canoe could withstand the forces projected from racing. When the final layer of concrete was finished, \nplastic sheeting was draped over the canoe to retain moisture, as described in ACI 308R-01 (ACI 2016). Six hours \nafter the final layer of concrete was placed, the sheeting was removed and calcium hydroxide (lime) soaked burlap \nwas placed on the canoe to retain moisture after initial setting with the plastic sheeting then placed over the burlap \nin an effort to maintain hydration of the concrete. \nAfter 24 hours of moist curing, the mold was transferred to the \ncuring tank where the burlap was kept saturated with lime-water at \n130 \u00b0F. The heated water was delivered via a porous hose for an initial \n14-day curing phase, using a drip technique which decreased the \noverall water demand while maintaining optimum curing conditions.  \nFurthermore, foam tubing was used to insulate the tank\u2019s intake \npiping, decreasing the amount of energy required to heat the conduits \ntransferring hot water from the water heater. Following the initial two-\nweek cure time, detachable platforms along the gunwales of the canoe \nwere removed to create lift-points, and the canoe was manually lifted \nfrom the form. Newly implemented rigid L-brackets were used to \ndisperse force over a larger area of the lift-points, thereby reducing the stresses applied to the gunwales. \nThe indentations created by the embedded shelf-liner inlays were then filled with \nthe aesthetic concrete mix to create the desired visual designs and letters (Figure 13). The \n3-D guitar outlay was precast in a female mold during casting day and placed onto the \ncanoe by using Free Floatin\u2019s aesthetic concrete mix as a bonding agent. Once the inlays \nand letters were filled with concrete, the canoe was planned to be submerged for an \nadditional 14-day curing phase. However, based on the strength gain profile developed \nby using the QC cylinders created on casting day, it was determined that Free Floatin\u2019 \nonly required 21 days of total cure time to reach design strength, which allowed the \nsecond curing phase to be limited from fourteen to just seven days.  \nOnce the canoe finished curing it was immediately sanded to expose pores, \nincreasing the permeability of the canoe which allowed for moisture to be extracted at an \naccelerated rate (Mehta & Monteiro 2014). The canoe was moved outdoors and was \nexposed to sunlight during the day while it was being sanded. During evening hours, the \ncanoe was placed into an insulated box with a space heater and dehumidifier which \nremoved condensation from within the tank. This moisture extraction method, which \nremoved 12 lbs. of water from the completed canoe, removed approximately 8% of Free Floatin\u2019s final weight. \nBeginning with 80 grit and incrementally increasing to 1500 grit sand paper, the canoe was sanded to the desired \naesthetic appeal and after application of two coats of concrete sealer, Free Floatin\u2019 was deemed race-ready.\nTable 7: Pour Day Concrete Mix QC Sheet \nMix \nNo. \nTheoretical \nWeight (lbs) \nMeasured \nWeight (lbs) \n% Diff \n1 \n27.192 \n27.066 \n0.46% \n2 \n27.192 \n27.029 \n0.60% \n3 \n27.192 \n27.095 \n0.36% \n4 \n27.192 \n27.112 \n0.29% \n5 \n27.192 \n27.102 \n0.33% \n6 \n27.192 \n27.117 \n0.28% \n7 \n27.192 \n27.018 \n0.64% \n8 \n27.192 \n26.996 \n0.73% \nFigure 13: Placement of \nInterior Inlays \nFigure 12: Team Members Applying Carbon \nFiber Reinforcement to Concrete Layer"}

Through \niterative experiments, three final concrete mixtures (Figure 9) achieved \nthe designed properties (Table 5). \nThe inner mix of Metrosilk provided an \nacceptable baseline mix due to its sufficient \nflexural strength and excellent workability. The \ncementitious materials incorporated 75% white \nPortland cement and 25% ground granulated \nblast furnace slag (GGBFS). The aggregate \ngradation which consisted of recycled glass Poraver\u00ae Siscorspheres, ranging in size from 0.1mm to 2 mm in \ndiameter, helped reduce the total unit weight. Inclusion of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber at 0.94 percent by volume \naided in an optimum flexural and tensile strength meanwhile restricting the cracks. VIVID-500(C) (ASTM C494), \na high-range water reducer, improved the workability of the concrete. The mix exhibited a 28-day compressive \nstrength of 1836 psi (ASTM C39) and a unit weight of 43.2 pcf (ASTM C138). \n An effort to improve sustainability \nprompted the design team to introduce a new \nkind of cementitious material to reduce the \namount of carbon-expensive Portland cement. \nMeanwhile, a kind of recycled powder(RP) was \napplied to achieve the goal. The powder was \nquite sustainable because it was made from grinded wasted bricks and concrete. To look into the properties of RP \nand make a comparison with silica fume (ASTM C1240), the design team applied the XRF and XRD to ascertain \nthe chemical constituents. Through the tests, the team obtained content of total silicon oxide, crystalline silicon \noxide and amorphous silicon oxide (Table 6). It could be found that the \ncontent of amorphous silicon oxide of RP nearly reached 35% of that of silica \nfume. Since the amount of amorphous silicon oxide is directly proportional \nto the reactivity of pozzolanic admixture and silica fume is a kind of \npozzolanic admixture with high reactivity, the prediction was put forward that \nRP had the potential to possess relatively high pozzolanic reactivity. To \nobserve the shape of surface and reveal the physical behavior of RP, the team \nchose to perform the SEM test of RP (Figure 10). Similar to silica fume, RP \nhas a rugged surface as well as an irregular shape, leading to the large specific \nsurface area. Both the chemical and physical property verified the RP as a \nsuitable cementitious material replacing silica fume and Portland cement.  \nTo optimize the relationship of sustainability and strength, several tests were performed in echelon to work \nout the dosage and the best proportion of RP and silica fume (Figure 11). According to the diagrams, a total dosage \nof 15% mass fraction and a 2:1 proportion between RP and silica fume were determined, which perfectly \noptimized the relationship between the hydration reaction brought by Portland cement and the pozzolanic reaction \nFig. 9.

Spellcast\u2019s structural mix had a \ncementitious blend consisting of 51% Portland \ncement, 13% grade 100 slag, and 36% Vitreous \nCalcium Aluminosilicate (VCAS\u2122) pozzolans by \ncementitious weight. Slag and VCAS\u2122 are \nsupplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), which \nembody less carbon dioxide (CO2) than Portland \ncement as industry byproducts. SCMs contribute to \nstrength gain via the pozzolanic reaction, wherein \nsiliceous components of the SCM react with the \nhydration byproduct calcium hydroxide to form \ncalcium-silicate hydrate, the main binder in concrete \n[24]. SCMs with high calcium oxide (CaO) content \nalso exhibit cementitious properties, contributing to \nearly strength through hydraulic activity [25]. For \nTrailblazer, early-age strength was prioritized to \nallow for wet sanding of the canoe 14 days after \ncasting, contributing to the float needed to implement \nan ambitious aesthetic design. Since slag has a CaO \ncontent of 42% compared to 21% in VCAS\u2122, slag \ncontent was increased throughout tests held at a \nconstant water to cementitious materials ratio (w/cm) \nand cementitious materials content. Increases in 14-\nday strength due to higher slag to VCAS\u2122 ratios also \nallowed reduction of Portland cement. Effective \nproportions were found to be 45% cement, 38% slag, \nand 17% VCAS\u2122, showing a 28% increase in \ncompressive strength over the baseline. \nAfter cement, slag, and VCAS\u2122 proportions were \ndetermined, focus shifted to incorporating Class F fly \nash. Due to high levels of cement replacement by slag \nand VCAS\u2122, only low-level fly ash replacements \nwere be considered. Below 15% of cementitious \nweight, fly ash does not have much effect on strength \nproperties [26]. The main motivation of adding fly ash \nas a cement replacement was to reduce cementitious \nweight, improve concrete sustainability, and \ncontribute to an ashy aesthetic in alignment with the \nnational park theme. Based on past mix design results, \nmixes containing fly ash up to 6% of cementitious \nweight were tested [27]. Mixers noted increased \nworkability with increased fly ash content, and there \nwere no adverse effects on strength across all \ncylinders. 6% replacement was selected to maximize \nunit weight reduction of cement. \nConcurrently, aggregate proportioning was \nadjusted through a series of tests varying percentages \nof LECA and CityMix\u00ae, as well as overall aggregate \ncontent. The baseline mix contained 71% aggregate \nby volume, half of which was CityMix\u00ae to fully \nutilize its low specific gravity. However, CityMix\u00ae \nnotably hindered concrete \nadherence due to its \nrelatively large particle \nsize of 3-4 mm compared \nto the LECA, which has a \nnominal maximum size of \n2.36 mm (Figure 9). This \nadditionally made the high \nCityMix\u00ae content mixes \nundesirable for casting the thin 1/8\u201d layers of the \ncanoe. CityMix\u00ae was ultimately decreased to 30% of \naggregate volume, and cm/agg was increased to \nincrease workability. An aggregate content of 64% \nand w/cm of 0.31 resulted in the best balance of \ncompressive strength at 3200 psi and unit weight of \n88 lb/ft3.

However, applying the formula to \nprevious canoes utilizing BCG showed that it \nconsistently underestimated composite flexural \nstrength by an order of magnitude. This suggested that \ncomposite flexural strength was mainly contributed by \nBCG, since the ACI formula was developed to \nestimate concrete flexural strength rather than \ncomposite strength. Following the form of the ACI \nformula, empirical composite flexural strength \nformulas were developed by performing power \nregressions on compressive and tensile vs composite \nflexural strength curves using data from past canoes \nthat used BCG. The tensile strength-based formula \nwas selected since flexural strength is typically used \nas an indirect measure of tensile strength in industry \n \nEmbodied \nCO2 \n(lb/lb) \nSpellcast \n(lb) \nTrailblazer \n(lb) \nSpellcast \n(lb CO2) \nTrailblazer \n(lb CO2) \nCO2 \nReduced \nCement \n0.913 \n368 \n297 \n336 \n271 \n15.7% \nSlag \n0.067 \n89.4 \n253 \n6.0 \n16.9 \nVCAS \n0 \n256 \n114 \n0.0 \n0.0 \nFly Ash \n0.004 \n0.0 \n42.2 \n0.0 \n0.2 \nTOTAL \n \n713 \n705 \n342 \n288 \nUCLA Concrete Canoe | 10 \n[33].

These students share one vision \u2013 they all want to build something new and \ninnovative that will surpass their predecessors. Each and every one of them are the building blocks of the next \ngeneration of engineers that will shape the world\u2019s infrastructures. Taking a child\u2019s building game as its main \ntheme, Letsgo is a canoe that everyone can relate to and represents the building blocks that will make the world \ntheir own play space. \nFor 42 years, Montreal\u2019s \u00c9cole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure has stood for technical advancement and social \ninvolvement, with motivated students who participate in the school\u2019s scientific clubs. It is in this atmosphere \nthat the concrete canoe club was born, 22 years ago. The team participates in the Upstate New York Concrete \nCanoe Conference (UNYCCC) and has had a great success at their competitions. \u00c9TS\u2019 team has, in fact, earned \n1st place in the regional tournaments for the last 9 years, and has won the national\u2019s 1st place in 2013 and 4th \nplace in 2015.\nDespite its many years of existence, the club still upholds the school\u2019s mantra to constantly improve itself and \nits canoe. This year the team expanded its technical expertise by adding another type of reinforcement in the \ncanoe; ribs. The team moved forward, knowing the technique had already been used in the club\u2019s past.  The \nconcrete mixture was designed by the team\u2019s genetic algorithm and artificial neural network tool, created by \nthe \u00c9TS club members and professors. This year, the team also created two new concrete mixtures which are \nnot used in the hull at all. In fact, their sole purposes are mechanical. One is a high performance, fast-acting \nconcrete mixture that holds pieces of the grid to the new ribs of the canoe. The other is a very liquid form of \nconcrete to adhere the inlays to the hull and keep the canoe structurally sound.  Finally, quality control and"}

Structurally, Samba\u2019s shape was an advantageous compromise. While \nit still had some weaknesses with its overall rigidity, the canoe made up for these \nby its lightweight concrete mix design. Unfortunately, due to cold weather, pad\u00ad\ndlers cannot practice outside during the winter and have to focus their efforts on \nindoor training. Before the winter, the paddlers practiced with a canoe made of \nfiberglass, a very lightweight material, which resembles the shape, size and weight \nof Letsgo. The \u00c9TS paddlers communicated their desire to increase the canoe\u2019s \nstability and overall behavior in the water.

Their maximum weights were from 170 \nlbs for women and 215 lbs for men. To be able to use this range accurately for all the competitions, the paddlers \nare also weighed before travelling to the competition. This practice has enabled the team to use a factor for live \nloads of 1.0. Many other factors and analyses were conducted to add to our knowledge of the canoe, such as the \nestimated weight, which is 110 lbs. A dead load factor of 1.25 \nwas used to approximate the actual weight. This factor was \nacquired based on a three-year comparison between the team\u2019s \nprevious canoes\u2019 estimated weights and their actual weights. \nFollowing the research of F. Paradis and G.

Mechanical \ninlay tests were conducted with the bonding mix on the \nexperimental canoe, and did not show any signs of failure \nor structural weakness. Finally, the colored concrete itself \nwas also tested on the experimental canoe. \nThe last addition to this year\u2019s canoe design was  its ribs. \nThe structural reinforcements are intended to support the canoe against water pressure forces. All the other \nprimary reinforcements were kept as they were in Samba. Two fiberglass rods (Pultral\u00ae, V-rod\u2122 150 #2) \nwere used for their adhesion, flexibility and density as in Samba.  The fiberglass grid (GlassGrid\u00ae, 8511\u2122) \nwas retained for its high mechanical strength, density, and thickness. For the ribs, the team calculated the ne\u00ad\ncessary strength needed; a search amongst various hardware stores found that even the smallest available steel \nrods exceeded our needs. The steel rods were selected for their ability to be bent into a custom shape without \nany treatment, and also because their thread gives a good adhesion to concrete. Therefore, the team purchased \nand prepared Stainless Steel Threaded Rods (Paulin\u00ae) to fit the canoe\u2019s design.  It was decided that a small \npiece of the grid had to be attached perpendicularly to the canoe. To do so,  the perpendicular grid pieces were \nattached to the ribs to create a mechanical link. The perpendicular grid pieces also act as another mechanical \nlink between the rib and the structural grid of the canoe. Therefore, different attaching methods were tested on \nthe experimental canoe. Five different methods were tested: one piece of grid was attached using fishing rope, \nand three others each had a unique HES concrete mixture designed by the R&D team. Finally, one rib sim\u00ad\nply had no attachment to its piece of grid. After the experimental canoe\u2019s cure and sanding, the grid\u2019s pieces \nwere examined. The rib using fishing rope and the rib with no attachment could not be used, as the methods \ncould not keep the grid pieces in place. However, all three of the concrete mixtures could adequately attach \ntheir pieces of grid to the ribs. The three HES mix proportions tested on the ribs had been validated in the \nlaboratory with the use of a semi-adiabatic calorimetry system. All three mixes were developed with calcium \naluminate cement (Lumnite, MG\u2122, Calucem\u00ae) for its high early strength. Soda-Lime/Borosilicate Glass \nMicrospheres (K37\u2122, 3M\u00ae) were used for reducing the density and were fine enough for the mix\u2019s paste \nquality. An Acrylic Latex Solution (ASTM C 1438) (Latex R\u2122, Sika\u00ae) was used to ensure a good adhesion \nwithout significantly affecting the compressive strength compared to the use of polymers (Jamshidi, 2013). \nThe 3 HES mixtures had different proportions; the one selected had the best compressive strength, the fastest \ninitial set, and the highest heat flow deployment.

Incorporation of only 0.1-0.3 mm \nTrue LiteTM as aggregate allowed for the 25% by \nvolume requirement (ASCE, 2017) to be met.  \nHowever, use of True LiteTM in the patch mix \ncontributed to higher than expected canoe weight. \n \nFinishing Mix:  A finishing mix was developed to \nprovide rich, integral color and theme integration \n(Table B.3).  The finishing mix was composed of \nPortland cement, 0.1-0.2 mm True LiteTM, and an \niron-oxide-based liquid dye.

Incorporation of True LiteTM positively \nimpacted the budget, because it was a donated \nmaterial \nthat \nreplaced \npreviously-purchased \nPoraver\u00ae.  Although optimization of the aggregate \nblend cowas tedious, it did not impact the project \nschedule (pg. 11).  Related to safety, concrete with \nblast furnace slag (such as True LiteTM) has higher \ntoxicity, as compared to Portland (Li et al., 2016).     \n \nUse of iron-oxide-based liquid dye was also an \ninnovation.  Use of liquid dye resulted in a slight \nincrease in the budget because it replaced a donated \nsource of integral color.  Due to the amount of time \nrequired to locate the product, the project schedule \nfor finishing was longer than expected (pg. 11).     \n \nSustainable Materials:  Sustainable materials \nwere incorporated into the mixes.

Common complaints of Imperium can be attributed to its overall \ndimensions. Imperium was a long canoe (near the maximum length) and had a very full shape. This resulted in a \nheavy canoe that was slow and not maneuverable. The team consistently finished near or at last place in each \nrace. Using this information, Olagashe was designed to a shorter length and much more streamlined shape.   \nAs shown in Table 4, Olagashe is a foot shorter, 1.5 inches narrower, and 0.5 inches less deep. Less weight \ndue to small dimensions would equate to faster speeds and would require less physical exertion to maneuver. A \nmoderate rocker of 1.5\u201d from center to end was decided upon for purposes of speed as well. The rocker causes \nless of the canoe to displace water, resulting in a shorter effective length. The cross-sectional shape was a shallow \narch with straight walls to the gunwale. No keel was used in Olagashe, since Imperium\u2019s keel was thought to \nhave caused some maneuverability \nissues.

Comparison of Structural Mixes \nOLAGASHE\n \nUniversity of Cincinnati\n \n4 \nOur group\u2019s main interest in type-s hydrated lime was based on its defining characteristics as an SCM as \nwell as its commercial availability. One of the most apparent characteristics in mortars and concretes is its \nplasticity. Though the most apparent characteristic, plasticity is not what persuaded the team to utilize this \nmaterial. Flexural bond strength with the use of hydrated lime was pertinent to its integration in the final structural \nmix. Traditionally used as masonry mortar, hydrated lime has been found to keep elasticity under building loads. \nTo relate to the needs from the material, the flexural forces applied to Olagashe can be combatted by this high \nelasticity. The final influential characteristic of hydrated lime was the studies of its autogenous healing. In the \npast, the team has had issues with shrinkage cracks around the hull. Hydrated lime was the solution to this \nproblem. Autogenous healing caused by the combination of the lime, air moisture, and CO2 after hairline cracks \noccur are replaced by calcium carbonate (limestone) crystallization. Qualitative optic inspections of 6\u201dx12\u201dx1/2\u201d \nplate molds filled with baseline mix and others with hydrated lime test mix revealed obvious micro crack \nreduction in the hydrated lime mixes tested.  \nVitreous calcium alumino-silicate (VCAS) was \nchosen to be paired with hydrated lime in the cementitious \nmatrix. Admirable traits of VCAS that led to its use include \nimproved workability, increased compressive strength, and \nsustainability. Still using the control aggregate proportions, \nseveral iterations of different replacement percentages of \nportland cement by VCAS and hydrated lime were created. \nQuantitative test results correlating the compressive and \nflexural strengths associated with percent replacement \ndifferentiation can be seen in Figure 2.  \nOnce the cementitious matrix was chosen, aggregate"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant that writes proposals for the ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "prompt": "Write the construction section for an ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "output": "team did was to reconstruct the team\u2019s leveling table.  Last year since a female mold was used, the \nleveling table was very low to the ground.  With this year\u2019s male mold, the team used 4x4\u2019s to add legs to it to \nmake it easier to work on the canoe.  \n \nThe form was constructed with expanded polystyrene (EPS) \nfoam. Each foam sheet for Olagashe\u2019s mold was 4\u2019x8\u2019x2\u201d which \nthe team estimated doubled the number of pieces required to make \nthe mold compared to Imperium\u2019s mold, which utilized 5\u201d thick \npieces.  Eleven full sheets were sent to the University of \nCincinnati\u2019s College of Design, Art, and Architecture (DAAP) to \nbe professionally CNC milled. This significantly reduced the cost \nof outsourcing the milling from UC.  The team collaborated with \nthe DAAP employees to form a process that used fewer sheets, \nproducing less waste, and decreased the machine time used in \nmilling the mold.  The CNC machine drilled 0.8\u201d holes into each \npiece.  Once the milling was complete, \u00bd\u201d PVC pipe was placed \ninto the holes to keep the sheets aligned correctly in the vertical \ndirection. The male mold is shown in Figure 3.  \n \nIn the past, the team has had a difficult time installing and \npouring \nback \nthe \nfoam end caps, so a \nnew \nmethod \nwas \nengineering to make it \neasier \nand \nmore \nefficient.  Once the mold was pieced together vertically, the team cut \n2\u2019 sections of the mold off from each end, which allowed them to \nremain in the canoe after stripping was completed. In 2016, the \nConcrete Canoe team had problems trying to make the end cap \ntransition appear flush on Cincinnatus VIII. To avoid that in 2019, \nthe team sliced off a \u00be\u201d piece from the top of the end caps and taped \nit on. Doing this allowed the finishers a nice edge to trowel to when \nencasing the foam end caps with concrete. \n \nOnce the mold was pieced together vertically, the team lined \nit up and a few strips of duct tape were placed on it going all the way \naround the canoe to hold it together, and then it was placed on the \nleveling table. The team tested a few different methods of form \nrelease: duct tape, masking tape, and liquid form release. The \nmasking tape had the best finish once stripped, but it was nearly \nimpossible to place on the sidewalls of the canoe, which are almost \nvertical. The duct tape specimen had a rougher finish than the \nmasking tape, but the finishers were able to place concrete on the \nvertical sidewalls. The finish on just the form release was not smooth \nFigure 3. Team members place PVC dowels into the \nEPS foam mold. \nFigure 4. The mold pre-pour with arrowheads \nand pre-tension cables in place. \nOLAGASHE\n \nUniversity of Cincinnati\n \n7 \nat all, so the team decided to use duct tape as a form release, which was placed onto the foam mold after being \nplaced on the leveling table in line with the pre-tension cable system. \n \nThe pre-tension cable system was different this year, since a male mold was implemented rather than a \nfemale mold like last year\u2019s Imperium.  The team used the same steel frame and turnbuckle system as Cincinnatus \nVIII and Imperium; however, the team decided on 1/8\u201d braided high-strength carbon fiber cables rather than steel.  \nBefore the concrete was placed, six cables were attached to the dead end and were tensioned to 185 pounds, then \ntied to the other end of the steel frame.  The team also implemented ~\u00bc\u201d precast concrete arrowheads to be used \nas spacers for the pretension cables, compared to drywall spacers used in Cincinnatus VIII.  The arrowheads were \nall oriented in the same way, forward.  This is to imply that the canoe is an \u201carrow\u201d shooting through the water.  \nThis is a big improvement from 2016\u2019s canoe, because the team did not have to spend time stripping the drywall \nspacers and patching all the voids that the spacers left.  The stiffened tri-axial carbon fiber mesh was cut before \nthe concrete was placed, that way the team could just place the mesh as placing occurred. Figure 4 shows the \nmold prior to pour day. \n \nPrior to pour day, cementitious materials, aggregates, dry admixtures, and fibers were measured, labeled, \nand organized per batch by the team.  This left only the liquid admixtures and water to be measured for each batch \nduring pour, which saved time while batching, making sure the placing team was not waiting on concrete.  The \nconcrete placement started at the stern of the boat.  The first of three crews, which consisted of less experienced \nmembers of the team, placed the first \u00bc\u201d of concrete.  The second crew, which consisted of more experienced \nmembers of the team, placed the stiffened carbon fiber mesh onto the first layer and then a second \u00bc\u201d layer of \nconcrete.  The second crew also acted as the quality control & quality assurance team.  Following behind them \nwas a finishing crew who was made up of members who had finishing experience.  The expanded shale in the \nmix this year made it hard to get a nice finish, so the mix design team created a finishing mix that was placed on \nthe canoe two weeks after the structural mix was placed, prior to \nany sanding. \n \nWith last year\u2019s Imperium, the team implemented a \nhumidity tent that consisted of plastic wrap and PVC pipe, all \nwithin the limits of the leveling table.  The team realized that \ngetting into the humidity tent to fill the humidifiers was very \ndifficult.  The"}

For \nexample, many people spent more time outdoors, participating in activities like camping and hiking. To celebrate \nthis love for the outdoors and the lifting of many of the COVID-19 \nrestrictions, the LUCC team decided to dedicate its theme to one of \nthe longest hiking trails in the eastern United States: the Appalachian \nTrail. The name Diamond Blaze pays tribute to the current white \nblazes that mark the trail, to the original diamond-shaped trail-blazes \nthat guided hikers, and to the stars that can be seen during a night on \nthe trail. This theme also honors the many people who have \nexperienced peace, freedom, and adventure hiking on this mountain \ntrail.  \n \nThe LUCC team considered the concrete mix one of the most crucial design aspects of Diamond Blaze. \nWhen approaching the mix design, two of the main considerations for the materials used were sustainability and \nweight.

The layer of resin was then sanded down to create a \nsmoother surface that was a closer approximation to the designed hull geometry. \nUsing the same process as previous years, a trained team member used a CNC laser to cut one-inch cross-\nsections into insulation foam for the three-foot end caps of the canoe. These foam cross-sections had holes cut \ninto them so that dowel rods could be inserted to keep the pieces in line. \nDuct tape was then wrapped around the assembled foam sections to \nbetter approximate a continuous hull geometry and allow for a smoother \nsurface for casting. \nSimilar to Music Row, the canoe team decided to include a \ndecorative inlay in the inner layer of concrete. This was done by cutting \nout the Appalachian Trail logo from \u00bc\u201d foam and placing this on the \ncenter of the mold prior to casting. \nWith the inlay and adhesion reducing measures in place, the \ncanoe mold was ready for the casting process.

The casting \nbegan at the tail of the canoe with the placement of a \u00bc\u201d layer of concrete onto the mold. Casting was completed \nincrementally as the concrete, mixed in five-gallon buckets, was created. Following the completion of the first \nlayer, a sheet of fiberglass mesh was stretched over the canoe and held tight as it was worked into the concrete. \nAnother \u00bc\u201d layer of the same mix was placed on top.

In addition to lab safety, \nLUCC team also had to be intentional about safety related to COVID-19. \nRegarding lab safety, members of the LUCC were \nrequired to wear closed toed shoes and goggles while working \nin the lab. In addition, dust masks were worn when working with \nconcrete and other materials that are dangerous to inhale. Before \ngaining clearance to work in any of the lab spaces, students are \nrequired to complete lab safety and training courses. Instead of \ndesignating one person to enforce safety on the team, each \ncaptain was responsible for enforcing safety in their respective \nareas. This approach allowed for a more detailed safety plan as \neach captain was most aware of the potential hazards in their \nportion of the project and could ensure that preventative \nmeasures were taken. \n \nIn reference to COVID-19 guidelines, the LUCC has expanded their use of online communication, \nusing GroupMe as the primary method of communication and utilizing Zoom when necessary for virtual meetings. \nMembers sat distanced at meetings, and in settings when social distancing was not possible, masks were worn \nwhen required by university policy. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 18: Prototype immediately following"}

Once the desired surface was \nobtained, a demolding agent was used to cover \nthe mock-up. \n \n \nOnce the mock-up was finished, the team began \nwith the framework, which first needed the \ndivisorial element to provide the form with two \nhalves that can be easily separated once the \nconcrete is ready.

To help work around \nthis issue, tests were performed to determine the time it \nwould take for a sample of concrete to set and become \nunplaceable. Set time was tested by using a Vicat \nNeedle Drop Test (ASTM C191) to test the stiffness of \nthe concrete sample at evenly spaced time intervals \n(Figure 7). The process used four concrete samples. \nTwo samples were created with a retarding admixture \n(Plastiment ES) incorporated into the concrete, and \ntwo were created without. Then, two samples, one of \neach kind, were placed in a refrigerator to test the \neffects of how cold temperatures would play a role on \nthe set time of the mixes. In total, two mixtures, one \nwith retarder and one without were left out to open \nroom temperature, while two others, again one with \nretarder and one without, were left in a cold \nenvironment. The test took place over the course of \nfour and a half hours, with tests being performed every \nfifteen minutes. Results showed that concrete with \nretarder and placed in a cold environment would be \nacceptable for several hours.

Canoe Curing in the Humidity Tent.\n12 \n \nValue \nThis design represents both definitions of \nvalue, focusing on improving the quality while \nensuring a cost-effective product. Sustainability is at \nthe forefront of many fields, and innovating methods \nthat guarantee little to no risk to the planet is crucial. \nProducing cement-based concrete is laborious and \ndangerous to the environment due to the amount of \ncarbon dioxide produced during the manufacturing \nprocess (\u201cCarbon Footprint, 2020). Yet sustainable \nalternatives are often considered more expensive \nresulting in underutilization in the manufacturing \nprocess. Using last year\u2019s test results as a baseline, \nthe team created a lightweight mix that excludes \nportland \ncement \nto \ncreate \na \ncost-effective, \nsustainable mix. The team achieved monetary value \nin three ways: removing expensive K37 glass \nbubbles from the mix, using basalt reinforcements \nrather than more costly alternatives, and creating a \nlighter mix requiring less mass of concrete. The K37 \nglass bubbles were one of the more expensive \ncomponents in last year\u2019s mix and made the mixes \ninconsistent, creating a heavier canoe than desired. \nExcluding K37 glass bubbles resulted in more \nconsistency, making the manufacturing process more \nstreamlined and less expensive. The team utilized a \nflexible basalt mesh reinforcement which was the \nleast costly option while still maintaining adequate \ncomposite flexural strength. A layering scheme was \nimplemented to improve the bond between layers \nand the overall durability of the product. The final \nmix had a relatively low density of 55.8 pcf.

Overall, \nthis design delivers a high-quality, sustainable design \nresulting in a cost-effective product. \nSustainability \nA critical component of making the canoe is \nensuring the project is sustainable. To address this a \nSustainability Lead was appointed. This Lead \nevaluated the environmental, social, and economic \nimpacts throughout the entire project.  \n \nThe field of engineering is continuously \nchanging and evolving.  For any sustainable \ninnovation to be applicable in the real world, it must \nbe affordable to implement, provide minimal \nenvironmental impact, and be practical. Continuing \nfrom last year\u2019s research, the team wanted to forgo \nportland cement and use GGBFS (ASTM C989) and \nhydrated type S lime (ASTM C207) as replacements. \nThese changes drastically decreased the project \nenvironmental impact. GGBFS is a recycled \nbyproduct of iron production. The production of \nGGBFS requires 90% less energy when compared to \nportland cement (CivilEngineeringTutor, 2018). This \ndifference can be attributed to the amount of fossil \nfuels burned during the process of creating and \ncalcinating the cement. Additionally, hydrated lime \ntakes fewer steps to produce and is fired at a lower \ntemperature \nthan \nportland \ncement \n(\u201cCarbon \nFootprint\u201d, 2020; Moropoulou et al., 2001). These \nfactors work together to decrease the carbon \nfootprint throughout the project. This change also \nreduced the water to cement ratio (w/cm) required to \nget a workable mix, which conserved water usage.  \nPortland cement-based mixes required a 0.89 w/cm \nratio, while the new mix only required a 0.4 w/cm \nratio (Latrodectus 2022). One downside of the \nchange is that lime is more expensive at a cost of \n$0.37 per pound while portland cement costs $0.34 \nper pound. The team decided to implement this \nchange despite the small increase in cost because the \nsustainable benefits outweigh the cost.  \n \nMultiple practices were implemented on \nPlace Day to increase sustainability. A layer of plastic \nwas secured to the table to stop water from saturating \nthe wooden tabletop which could lead to potential \nrotting. The plastic used was recovered and stored for \nrepurposing. Furthermore, a high degree of focus \nwas placed on accurately placing concrete to avoid \nwastage. This saved material and was simple for the \nteam to implement. \n13 \n \nThe team also fostered knowledge retention \nby using a matrix style organization. This allowed \ncross communication between all team members \nensuring they have a broad knowledge in all aspects. \nWhen members were absent other team members \ncould effortlessly fill in. This also helped with the \ntransfer of knowledge between experience team \nmembers and new team members, providing the \nfoundation for success in future years. \nImprovements \nThe Youngstown State University Team \nstrives to improve every year. One improvement this \nyear was the composite reinforcement scheme. \nFlexible basalt mesh was used as the primary \nreinforcing material. Basalt is often viewed as the \noptimal steel reinforcement replacement. It has \nsuperior adhesion to concrete, is easier to work with, \nand does not corrode. Basalt mesh also has a higher \ntensile strength of 1458 MPa versus 1284 MPa for \nsteel (Decky et al., 2022). With this knowledge and \nextensive test data, the team decided to use basalt as \nthe primary reinforcement. \nLast year, the concrete canoe team used rigid \nbasalt mesh. This created issues because the \nreinforcement needed to be heated and formed to the \ncorrect shape, and consequently the preceding \nconcrete layer had to be fully placed before the next \nlayer could begin. This could potentially lead to \nissues with delamination due to cold joints \n(Seegebrecht, 2021). Flexible basalt eliminated this \nissue. The flexibility of the new basalt meant it could \nbe cut and placed right behind the people troweling \nallowing the third layer to be started while the second \nwas still being placed. This is anticipated to lead to \nan improved bond between the second and third \nlayers on the canoe. \nInstead of only using thickness guides to keep \nuniform thickness, depth gauges were also used. The \ngauge was made from a standard two in nail with tape \nat the correlating thickness for each layer (Figure \n12). These were easy to use and could be used at any \ntime in the process. The depth gauges created a more \nconsistent thickness throughout the canoe. \nAdditionally, the team created an improved \nhumidity tent. This was done to decrease the amount \nof time required to set up the plastic over the canoe. \nLast year, cables were run over the top of the canoe \nand secured to the table and supports. This year, three \nwooden frames were constructed to fit around the \ncanoe. They were coated in paint to preserve them.  \n \n \nOn Place Day after the frames were in place, plastic \nwas attached, and the frame secured to the table. This \ntent had a smaller volume required to keep humid \nversus previous methods. \nAn additional purpose for the wooden frame \nwas to make an enclosure to be used during the oven \ndrying process. The team created a heated insulated \nbox to dry the canoe. A heater was used to increase \nthe temperature inside the enclosure uniformly \nevaporating excess moisture from the canoe. \nInlay mixes were improved this year. In the \npast the same mix was used for the canoe and inlays. \nThis caused a delay since that mix took two weeks to \ncure. With the addition of an accelerator the inlay \nmix can be sanded the following day helping \nstreamline canoe"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant that writes proposals for the ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "prompt": "Write the construction section for an ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "output": ".  \nOne of the biggest improvements was a new \nfacility to construct the canoe. An existing flower \nshop building was retrofitted into a team center for \nall engineering competition teams at the university. \nEach team had a designated area in the building. This \nallowed the canoe team to organize the space more \nefficiently through the 5S method (Figure 13). With \nthis in place the team could more efficiently track and \nfind materials, tools, and supplies. \n \n \n \nFigure 12. Depth-Guage ensuring proper thickness.\nFigure 13. Materials organized through the 5S method.\n14 \n \nAll team members had easy access to the \nbuilding. In the past, the canoe team had to share lab \nspace with classes, which made scheduling work \nsessions complicated. In the old lab space ventilation \nconsisted of a single fume hood which, was prone to \nbreakdowns. The new facility has a portable fume \nhood which was moved to work areas as required. \nAdditionally, extra ventilation was supplied by \nopening one or more of the building's four garage \ndoors. The new facility inspired the canoe theme by \nencouraging the team to reconnect with their roots, \ndemonstrating how age-old processes can bloom to \ncreate beautiful new innovations. \nManufacturing Cost Estimate \nImprovements \nare \nessential \nto \nany \nmanufacturer, but manufacturing costs also play a \nvital role. Manufacturing costs consist of three \ncategories: direct material, direct labor, and overhead \ncosts (Manufacturing Costs Definition, 2023). Direct \nmaterial includes the cost of the material to produce \nthe canoe, such as cementitious material, pozzolans, \naggregate, admixtures, pigment, and reinforcement. \nSealers and stains are also considered direct \nmaterials since they are part of the finished product. \nThe direct material cost was $83,616 for all 100 \ncanoes, which is 3% of the total manufacturing cost. \nThis percentage is drastically different than the \npercentage for direct labor at 46%. The material is \ninexpensive compared to the labor costs because the \nprocess of producing a concrete canoe is very time \nconsuming. The lead time for the canoes can be \nreduced whereas the direct material cost can rarely \nbe reduced because prices are dictated by external \nsuppliers who do not typically reduce cost. \nFortunately, direct labor and overhead costs can be \ncontrolled and optimized to decrease the overall \nmanufacturing costs. \nDirect labor included the labor that directly \nfabricated the canoe and produced value-added \nwork. Value-added work transformed materials into \na product that the client requires (Coutinho, 2021). \nThe direct labor for manufacturing the canoes would \nbe the laborers who worked approximately 30,600 \nhours at a cost of $1,147,500 for all 100 canoes. \nSince labor cost cannot be expected to be reduced, \nthe number of hours spent on each canoe would need \nto be reduced to decrease the overall direct labor cost. \nThis has been a focus of the design team which has \nworked diligently to reduce the amount of time it \ntakes to find different items throughout the facility. \nThe team implemented the 5S system that many Lean \ncompanies utilize. Through the implementation of \n5S, the team reduced time looking for items after \ntools and equipment were sorted, cleaned, and in a \nstandard location. Through this system, the laborers \ndid not have to waste time walking throughout the \nfacility looking for items. Overall, the 5S method had \na positive effect on cost. \nAdditionally, \nthe \nteam \nminimized \nmanufacturing costs by analyzing the overhead costs \nassociated with the production of the canoes. Items \nclassified under the overhead cost can typically be \nreused, making most items a one-time fee. For \nexample, the gunwale and thickness guides can be \nreused for all 100 canoes. The inlay foam, plastic \nroll, and plastic bags can be reused for multiple \ncanoes. Unfortunately, the form will need to be \nreplaced after every canoe; however, this can be an \nopportunity to significantly reduce cost if a reusable \nform can be designed. These items were considered \nindirect material or material that is required but does \nnot specifically create the canoe. The indirect \nmaterial cost accounts for $447,730, or about 18% of \nthe total manufacturing cost of $2,485,885 for all 100 \ncanoes. Another part of the overhead cost includes all \nindirect labor such as the design engineering,"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant that writes proposals for the ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "prompt": "Write the hull design and structural analysis section for an ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "output": "was to increase straight-line speed without sacrificing turning speed. \nPaddler preference led the team to use the 2016 UFCC canoe, Category 6, as a baseline design, because its flat-\nbottomed hull offers optimal maneuverability and primary stability during race turns (UFCC 2016) (Table 4). \nAlthough Category 6 had a fast turning speed, its ease of \nmaneuverability resulted in difficulties with respect to maintaining \ncontrol over long straight-line distances. Therefore, considerations for \nthe design of Zest\u2019s hull were to determine the best tradeoff between \nincreased straight-line speed and decreased maneuverability.  \nThe paddling team regularly practiced in Category 6, and the biggest concern expressed by the team was \nthe distance between the gunwales and the water surface when turning. Paddlers reported that the small distance \ncaused them to hesitate when turning, diminishing the effect of Category 6\u2019s designed maneuverability. To \naddress this problem, the design team used a minimum gunwale height of 1.19 ft as compared to the baseline\u2019s \n1.13 ft (UFCC 2016). The incremental height increase effectively served to alleviate the paddlers\u2019 concerns. \nThe process of designing models in FREE!shipTM revealed that lower rocker heights increase the waterline \nlength of the canoe (FREE!ship Plus 2013). A longer waterline length can increase potential straight-line speed \nand decrease maneuverability (Winters 2006). Although UFCC canoes traditionally have low rocker heights at \nthe stern compared to the bow, this year\u2019s team designed potential hulls with a relatively higher stern rocker \nheight to find the ideal combination. The height difference between the bow and the stern changes the underwater \nprofile of the canoe and therefore affects potential wave-making resistance when in motion. \nA second approach to increasing straight-line speed was rounding the hull, a major change to the overall \nshape of the canoe. In comparison to a flat-bottom hull, a rounder hull decreases potential wave-making resistance \nand maneuverability (Winters 2006). To round the bottom of the hull, the vertical distance between the chine \njunction and keel of the hull was increased by 1 in. in FREE!shipTM (FREE!ship Plus 2013). Intermediate spline \npoints were then moved by their relative distance from the chine junction to optimize the curvature of the hull. \nUsing a combination of lower rocker heights and rounded hulls, ten potential hulls were designed and modeled \nusing FREE!shipTM (FREE!ship Plus 2013). \nTo narrow the selection for potential hulls, designs \nwere compared for potential wave-making resistance using \nthe fluid dynamics program Michlet (Michlet 2013). \nResistance was analyzed for hull speeds ranging from 1 to 6 \nknots (1.7 to 10.1 ft/s) to replicate speeds achieved during the \nco-ed race.

To account for dynamic forces from paddler \nmovement and waves during races, a factor of 1.25 was applied to race loading cases (Paradis and Gendron 2007). \nThe male race loading scenario produced the critical loading case with a maximum negative bending moment of \n660 lb-ft located 10.75 ft from the stern. Using the location of the section\u2019s neutral axis and moment of inertia, \nthe tensile and compressive stresses in the section were calculated to be approximately 240 psi and 110 psi, \nrespectively, with a factor of safety of 1.1 for the lateral loading case.  \nDue to its reliability in previous canoes, Kevlar\u24c7 woven carbon fiber mesh was used to meet the required \ntensile strength calculated along the longitudinal axis.

To prevent the loss of speed \ngenerated by this reduction, global width was reduced \nby one inch, creating a decrease in friction drag and \nleading to an improved maximum speed. Everywhere \nthe beast sails, Azathoth will be wreaking havoc.

The \nproperties of each mixture are presented in Table 2. The \nbody of the beast as well as its teeth were cast with a \nstructural concrete mix, while the details regarding its \noutside appearance were made using a non-structural \nmix to facilitate placement. Another mix was \nspecifically created to form Azathoth\u2019s white staring \neye. To obtain the grim white color, the usual gray \ncement was replaced with white cement. Additionally, \nthe silica fume was entirely removed from this mix due \nto its substantial darkening effect. \nAzathoth\u2019s male mold, including its gunwales \nand ribs, was sculpted from dense polystyrene foam \nblocs by a five-axis Computer Numerical Control \n(CNC) machine. A dark red color was chosen for the \nfirst layer to mimic the monster\u2019s maw and a shocking \ndeep blue color was selected for the rest of its body. \nPrimary and secondary reinforcements reported in \nTable 1 were used to prevent micro-cracking and to \nincrease the overall resistance of the prototype. The \nteam drastically changed the placement technique from \npast editions. Instead of hand placing the concrete \ndirectly onto the mold, it was pre-rolled into 5/64-inch-\nthick sheets using plastic gauges and rollers.

Universit\u00e9 Laval\u2019s concrete canoe team \nachieved perfection, and is pleased to present its brand-\nnew prototype: Clockwise! \nUniversit\u00e9 Laval's chronicles of success over \nthe past 26 years highlight the team as a strong \ncontender to manufacture the standardized canoe \ndesign. The team has won the Canadian National \nConcrete Canoe Competition a total of twelve times. \nLaval joined the New England Concrete Canoe \nConference in 2007 and has since participated nine \ntimes in the National Concrete Canoe Competition with \nfive top three performances. \n Clockwise\u2019s shape is a combination of Space \nOddity (2016), LCC-22 (2017), LavalLand (2018), and \nALL IN (2019), four previous canoes designed by the \nteam, as they all offer different qualities. The length of \nthe prototype is reduced by seven inches compared to \nALL IN (2019) to keep the balance between straight line \nperformance and maneuverability. Its bow and stern \ndepths are increased by one inch to improve tracking \nwithout affecting the canoe\u2019s turning ability. This \nimproves \nracers\u2019 \nefficiency \nand \nspeed. \nHull \nmodifications were thoroughly tested during water \nexperiments with scaled models of Clockwise and ALL \nIN (2019). Clockwise\u2019s specifications are presented in \nTable 1. \n The choice and optimization of three different \nconcrete mixtures is the result of a three-month-long \niterative process. Concrete properties are displayed in \nTable 2. Clockwise\u2019s hull is made of a multiple-colored \nstructural concrete to imitate copper, the most \nprominent material of the Industrial Revolution. The \nprototype\u2019s bas-relief is filled with a non-structural mix \nthat has a plasticine texture to facilitate its placement in \ncomplex shapes, whereas a mixture for engravings is \ndesigned without fiber, allowing it to fill fine lines. \nClockwise\u2019s male mold is built using a five-axis \nComputer Numerical Control (CNC) machine which \naccurately sculpt the shape of the canoe, including \ngunwales and ribs. The concrete is hand-placed to \ncreate a realistic tricolor metallic texture. Primary and \nsecondary reinforcements shown in Table 1 are used to \nprevent micro-cracking and increase the resistance of \nthe prototype. An increased precision regarding the \nlayers\u2019 thickness makes it possible to control the \nposition of the fiberglass mesh in order to ensure an \nadequate concrete cover. \nLast year's activities did not include the"}

An additional mesh is also added in Clockwise\u2019s \ngunwales in addition to carbon fiber strips in its ribs to \nresist the weight of the racers during turns creating \nlongitudinal and transversal bending. \nThe concentrated punching underneath the \npaddlers\u2019 knees during turns is expected to generate \nlocal shear that could pierce the canoe. With a safety \nfactor of two, the calculated shear is 153.6 psi. For \nClockwise, as in previous canoes, a second mesh layer \nis also used in this area to ensure a better stress \ndistribution.

This aids navigation around buoys. \nThe prismatic coefficient, Cp, was calculated \nfor El Fey to quantify the performance of the hull \nwith the changes made (Table 4).

Cal Poly\u2019s motto, \n\u201cLearn by Doing\u201d, guides the team as they produce an \nelegant and sustainable canoe. \nCal Poly teams have placed first in 19 of the last \n22 competitions in the Pacific Southwest Conference \n(PSWC). Jumanji (2015) placed second in the nation \nand Asteria (2016) placed second in regionals, while \nMeraki (2017) won the national competition. Five new \ncaptains joined five returning captains to defend last \nyear\u2019s national title. The team accomplished several \ngoals and introduced new innovations listed in Table 1. \nFinal canoe specifications are listed in Table 2. \nTable 1.

This \ndistance is known as the righting lever (Figure 4) and \nis the determining factor in canoe stability (Guillemot \nKayak 2016). \nFigure 4. Righting Lever \nA larger righting lever indicates the canoe has \nmore resistance against tipping. By examining the \neffects of cross-section design on Jumanji\u2019s high \nstability, the team concluded a canoe with a rounded \nbottom and slightly flared walls would increase the \nrighting lever at a faster rate. As a result of these \nchanges, Van Gogh\u2019s righting lever increases at a rate \nof 0.107 in/deg during the first ten degrees of heel in \ncontrast to Meraki\u2019s rate of 0.99 in/deg. Paddlers \nconfirmed the physical significance of these values \nwhen comparing the stability of practice canoes.  \nAfter paddlers noted the nose of the canoe \ndiving beneath the water during the previous year\u2019s \ncanoe races, the team examined Meraki\u2019s design to \ndetermine the reason for its powerful pitching. The \nteam concluded the canoe had areas of concentrated \nmass at the nose and tail due to the compacted concrete \nnecessary to achieve their axe-bow style. The \nconcentrated mass increases the moment of inertia \ncompared to a canoe with a conventional nose and tail. \nA high moment of inertia increases the angular \nmomentum of the canoe when waves cause it to pitch. \nThis increase in angular momentum means the nose \nplunges further underwater before the canoe can \nstabilize.   \nPhysically, a canoe with a heavy nose and tail \nwill tend to dive under the water when impacted by \nsmall waves. To combat this issue, the team redesigned \nthe nose and tail using Jumanji as a guide to feature a \nmore vertical profile. This decreased the volume of \ncompacted concrete from approximately 200 in3 to 50 \nin3 (Figure 5). \nFigure 5. Profile Comparison of Meraki and Van Gogh \nWhile redesigning the canoe, the team used its \nweight as a factor for design selection. In addition to \nreducing weight at the nose and tail, the team chose a \nrounded bottom to decrease the canoe\u2019s surface area \nfrom 61.3 ft2 to 59.9 ft2.

This empirical method produced smaller \nstresses, showing that theoretical calculations were a \nconservative estimate of actual stresses. \n \nTo reduce the tensile demands, captains utilized \na PT system with stainless steel cables.

Therefore, the team determined \nthat removing Q-Cel\u00ae and S38 was a more economical \nsolution to decrease unit weight than significantly \nincreasing the dosage of the air-entraining admixture. \nStarting with Meraki\u2019s admixture and latex \nbaseline of Darapel\u00ae, Darex\u00ae II AEA, ADVA\u00ae Cast \n555, Eclipse\u00ae 4500, and styrene butene latex, the team \ntested one new admixture and two new latexes. From \nthe admixture baseline, the team retained Darapel\u00ae, \nDarex\u00ae, Eclipse\u00ae, and ADVA\u00ae. Darapel\u00ae, a water \nrepellent, creates a hydrophobic film throughout the \nconcrete (GCP 2017). Darex\u00ae, an air entrainer, reacts \nwith water to evenly disperse microscopic air bubbles \nto reduce unit weight (GCP 2017). Captains increased \nthe dosage of Darex\u00ae due to the addition of fly ash \n(Jolicoeur et al. 2009). Eclipse\u00ae, a shrinkage reducer, \nlowers the surface tension in the pore water space (GCP \n2017). ADVA\u00ae, a high-range water reducer, improves \nworkability with less water, increasing strength (GCP \n2017). This year, the team introduced the admixture \nMaster X-Seed\u00ae 55. This admixture injects calcium \nsilicate hydroxide (CSH) strength molecules into the \nmix, facilitating early strength gain and furthering CSH \ngrowth within the concrete (BASF 2017). This \nincreased compressive strength by 10% without \nnegatively affecting unit weight (ASTM C109). \nTo improve the strength and cohesion of the \nmix, the team tested higher dosages of two new latexes: \nSikaLatex\u00ae R Acrylic Fortifier and Concrete Bonding \nAdhesive as well as QUIKRETE\u00ae Concrete Acrylic \nFortifier. Latex creates a film that envelops the \naggregates, holding them together and making the \nconcrete stronger in flexure and compression \n(Ghorpade et al. 2013). The team chose QUIKRETE\u00ae \nConcrete Acrylic Fortifier because its thinner \nconsistency did not impact the workability of the mix \ndespite an increased dosage. \nThe team found that inserting the admixtures in \nthe following order had the greatest benefits to the \nconcrete\u2019s strength and unit weight: Darex\u00ae, ADVA\u00ae, \nEclipse\u00ae, Darapel\u00ae, and Master X-Seed\u00ae 55. Mix \ncaptains allotted two minutes between the addition of \nadmixtures and the latex. This time period allowed \nDarex\u00ae to react with the batch water without being \nimpeded by the de-foaming agent in the latex. \nFor the secondary reinforcement, this year\u2019s \nteam used 8mm PVA fibers, which increased \ncompressive strength by 17% and tensile strength by \n12%, compared to Meraki\u2019s 6mm PVA fibers.

To accomplish this, a set-\naccelerating admixture, Daraset\u00ae, replaced Darex\u00ae in a \nmix consisting of Type 1 white, silica fume, Poraver\u00ae, \nand Utelite. Captains used Type 1 white instead of \nType 1L because it has a faster reaction time. Test \nresults showed mixtures with Type 1 white had a 13% \nincrease in compressive strength compared to mixtures \nwith Type 1L when tested at 18 hours (ASTM C109). \nCaptains included silica fume because it increases early \nstrength gain without affecting the speed of the \nhydration process (Kosmatka and Wilson 2016). This \nproduced a quickset mix with a 28-day compressive \nstrength of 3,150 psi and a tensile strength of 353 psi. \nTo depict Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cThe Starry Night\u201d, a \nlarge inlay was placed throughout the interior of the \ncanoe. Captains were concerned about this inlay \naffecting the structural integrity of the canoe, so the \nhigh strength quickset mix was modified to fill the \ninlays. The team replaced Utelite with the lighter \ncolored HydroLite\u00ae to create more vibrant colors and \nremoved the set-accelerating admixture. The finishing \nmix has a 28-day strength of 2,200 psi in compression \nand 330 psi in tension. Tests on flexure plates (ASTM \nC947) found that inlays filled with this finishing mix \nexhibited flexural strength that exceeded structural \ndemands.  \nCuring \nAfter establishing Van Gogh\u2019s mix, the team \nshifted its focus to creating a curing process that would \nallow the concrete to reach its highest possible strength \nand reduce the canoe\u2019s weight. The curing process \nbegan with an 8-hour dry cure to reduce free water on \nthe concrete surface prior to the 4-hour carbonation \ncuring process. This allowed carbon dioxide to \npenetrate a larger surface area, increasing carbon \nuptake. A 4-hour carbonation curing process, combined \nwith a controlled environment of 73\u00b0F and 60% \nhumidity, was found to be optimal for carbon uptake \n(CPCC 2017). The lower humidity allowed for a drier \nsurface for carbon to react with the concrete, while still \nproviding enough moisture for hydration. Carbonation \ncuring was used to initiate early strength gain and to \nreduce micro-cracking (Rostami et al. 2012).   \nCarbonation curing was followed by a 21-day \nwet curing process at 100\u00b0F and 99% humidity. The \ntemperature was increased to 100\u00b0F compared to the \nASTM C192 curing temperature of 73\u00b0F because it \nresulted in higher tensile strength (Ghani et al. 2006). \nFinally, the canoe was dry cured for seven days at \n100\u00b0F to remove moisture from the canoe.  \nThis final dry curing process was implemented \nfor four primary reasons. First, due to the significant \namount of latex in the mix, the concrete is strongest \nwith periods of wet and dry curing (Chen and Liu \n2007). Second, concrete is stronger in compression at a \nlower moisture content because a reduction in water \nincreases \nthe \nfriction \nforce \nbetween \nparticles \n(Saricimen 2000). Third, lower water content \nminimizes the internal force incompressible water \nexerts on concrete when deformed (Chen et al. 2012). \nLast, the dry curing process allows for dry shrinkage to \noccur before PT, decreasing creep and shrinkage losses \nof the PT cables. This innovative curing process \nresulted in a decrease in unit weight and an increase in \ncompressive and tensile strengths compared to ASTM \nC192 curing conditions.

Initial iterations in the mix design altered the \ncementitious blend. With restrictions on hydraulic \ncement content, an emphasis was placed on finding \ninnovative applications of supplementary cementitious \nmaterials (SCMs), following UFCC\u2019s rich history [14] \n[19]\u2013[21]. Considerations ranged from Metakaolin, \nSugar Cane Ash, and Pozzotive Ground Glass \nPozzolan\u00ae, which were found to impact the workability \nof the mix negatively. The continued use of slag cement \nfrom last year was chosen due enhanced plastic \nproperties for hand placement. The team opted for the \ncontinued use of portland IL cement, as it has \ncomparable performance to type I/II and a reduced \ncarbon footprint of 12% [22]. \nInspired by research at UF, the team sought to \nuse a product that would otherwise go to waste: Class F \nhigh-chloride fly ash. While fly ash is a common SCM, \nnew environmental regulations specifying maximum \nmercury contents in emissions are causing elevated \nchloride contents. Since chloride ions accelerate \ncorrosion, restrictions are placed on permissible \nchloride contents in fly ash to avoid reduced lifecycles \nin reinforced systems. However, given the severe \nshortage of permissible fly ash, it is necessary to look \nat potential applications of these byproducts deemed \n\u2018unusable\u2019. Sourced from a U.S. manufacturing facility, \nthe fly ash used by the team surpasses the limit for \nChloride Content (CC) set by the American Concrete \nInstitute (ACI) [23]. Current research indicates that \nhigh chloride content cement (0.2%) maintains the \nbeneficial fresh and hardened concrete properties of \nlow-chloride fly ash (0.01%) mixes [24]. The team's use \nof noncorrodible carbon fiber reinforcement allows this \nproduct, which would otherwise be discarded, to be a \nlandmark innovation in Incinegator. \nIn developing the cementitious blend, the team \nperformed trial mixes with a fixed aggregate \ncomposition. To gauge plastic properties, the flow table \ntest per ASTM C1437 and qualitative troweling \nsessions were performed, with flows between 5.5-6.5 \ninches exhibiting consistency for placement based on \nlead troweller feedback [25]. Previous mix designs \nshowed inconsistent performance with respect to plastic \nproperties and the improper bonding of layers, resulting \nin shrinkage and delamination upon demolding, so \nfresh concrete QC was a priority. To measure hardened \nconcrete properties, compressive and splitting tensile \nstrengths were taken at 7-day intervals of heated lime \ncuring using ASTM C39 [26] and ASTM C496 [27], \nrespectively (Table 4). Final prospective mixes were \ntested for flexural strength per ASTM C78 [16] with \nmodified dimensions for panels and the leno weave \ncarbon fiber reinforcement for the most representative \nstrength assessment [16] [25]\u2013[29]. \n \nTable 4: Mix Design Specifications vs. 21-Day Strength \nMix \nCompressive (psi) \nTensile (psi) \nSpecifications \n56 \n152 \nStructural \n2620 \n240 \nAesthetic \n2500 \n220 \nSeeking to accelerate the manufacturing process \nof the canoe, the team saw an opportunity in concrete \nstrength"}

Past teams relied on 3MTM S38 \nGlass Microspheres to produce buoyant concrete, \nconstituting almost a third of the mix volume [20] [21] \n[31]. To ensure compliance, the team increased the \nvolume of Poraver\u00ae, a recycled expanded glass \nlightweight aggregate in 0.1-0.4 mm, 0.25-0.5 mm, 0.5-\n1.0 mm, and 1.0-2.0 mm increments as the primary \ncontributor to the lightweight structural mix. Stalite\u00ae, a \ndenser, \nstronger \nnatural \nlightweight \naggregate \ncomposed of slate, was introduced at 30% of the \ncomposite and decreased until the optimal combination \nof theoretical weight and tensile strengths were \nachieved.

This \nwas done to ensure that varying voids would not negate \ntrial mix workability and strength improvements. The \nmodel would dictate the Poraver\u00ae gradation from \nprescribed constraints of the specific trial, resulting in \nthe proportions seen in Table 5. With S38\u2019s new \nclassification as aggregate, its inclusion in the Funk and \nDinger method improved the depiction of all particle \ninteractions compared to Tunnel Vision. \n \nTable 5: Aggregate Proportions \nThe team found that with the optimal \ncementitious content and properly graded aggregate \n(Table 5), good workability for casting could be \nachieved without an overabundance of superplasticizer. \nSuperplasticizers \npreviously \nbrought \nabout \nQC \nconcerns with varying slump values based on mixing \ntimes; therefore ADVA\u00ae Cast 600 content was reduced. \nInstead, the dosages of superplasticizer and Zyla\u00ae 610, \na mid-range water reducer, were designed solely to \nreduce water content and subsequently improve \nstrength capacities.

Preference was given to \nmaterials with positive lifecycles that also fulfilled the \ngoal of manufacturing potential, best exemplified by \nform material selection. Cork, a natural, recyclable, and \ncarbon-neutral material demonstrated properties key to \nform longevity [34] [41]. The high-density material \ncould be CNC routed into precise shapes and withstand \nthe pressures generated by canoe production. Cork is \nharvested from the bark of trees and subject to \nprocessing and transport prior to becoming a consumer \nproduct. In its application to the CCC, CNC routing \ngenerated scrap material that was donated to The \nRepurpose Project\u00a9, a non-profit organization in \nGainesville, FL dedicated to diverting waste from \nlandfills [42]. In manufacturing applications, a sealed \ncork form would act to sequester carbon over the course \nof its life. Ultimately, cork delivered superior canoe \nquality and minimized environmental impact.  \nWith cement production accounting for up to \n8% of global CO2 emissions, a focus on concrete \nsustainability was vital [43]. To minimize cement \ncontent in canoe production, the mix design team \nemployed the byproducts fly ash and slag cement as \nSCMs. However, a shortage of authorized fly ash \ncaused by product demand necessitated an investigation \nof fly ashes deemed \u2018low quality\u2019 [24]. As in \nIncinegator, \nconcrete \nwith \nnoncorrodible \nreinforcement was identified as a use case for high-\nchloride fly ash. Utilizing this noncommercially \navailable material both offset carbon emissions and \ndiverted waste from landfills.  \nAn \nembodied \ncarbon \ncalculator \nwas \nimplemented as a tool to evaluate the total carbon \nemissions associated with concrete production (Figure \n23) [44]. The final mix designs delivered ideal plastic \nFigure 21: Use of QC Tools \nFigure 22: QC \nCylinders Collection \n TECHNICAL APPROACH \n14 \n TECHNICAL APPROACH \n15 \n \n \nand hardened properties with associated carbon \nemissions of 17.0 kg CO2 eq. per canoe manufactured. \nIncinegator\u2019s design has 39% of the associated \nemissions of a fully hydraulic cement mixture, \ndemonstrating a sustainable approach to mix design. \nEconomic sustainability came in tandem with \nenvironmental efforts. Cork form redesign, for \nexample, reduced both material requirement and \nproject cost by $965. In addition, efforts were made to \nreuse materials: form support wood was acquired from \nthe previous year's Timber Strong competition and \ndisplay stands were fabricated from the UF Eckhoff \nSteel Bridge team\u2019s scrap material. \nSocial sustainability was achieved by building \ninternal and external support programs. To create \npathways for future captains, the team employs a \ntechnician program that allows students passionate \nabout UFCC to be mentored by current captains. The \nbarriers to entering the team are diminished by no \nexpectation of prerequisite knowledge and high \nworkload \ndemands. \nTechnicians \ngain \nvaluable \nexperience that increases team knowledge transfer as \nthese technicians return as captains the next year. \nAdditionally, diversity, equity and inclusion were \nemphasized by external recruiting from organizations \nsuch as Society of Women Engineers, Society of \nHispanic Engineers, and Out in Stem. A safe and \nwelcoming \nengineering \nenvironment \nfostered \ncamaraderie among team members.  \nHealth and Safety \nThe two main priorities of the UFCC \nEnvironmental Health and Safety (EH&S) program are \nto ensure a safe working environment for members and \nto comply with the University of Florida EH&S \nDepartment policies. A \u2018Safety Steward\u2019 was appointed \nto oversee and implement the EH&S program. \nRestrictions and procedures due to COVID-19 follow \nUF policy, which held a \u201crecommended but not \nrequired\u201d stance on masks and vaccination status. \nOnline options for all team meetings were available to \nany member that tested COVID-19 positive or \ndisplayed symptoms to ensure the health of other \nindividuals. \nBefore working in the UF Weil Hall Structures \nand Materials Laboratory, each team member or \nvolunteer must complete a safety training course and \nattend a detailed lab tour administered by the laboratory \nmanager. \nThe \ncourse \nfollows OSHA Laboratory \nSafety \nGuidance \nand \nincludes \ntraining \non \nhazardous waste management, \npersonal protective equipment \n(PPE), \nand \nenvironmental \nregulations \n(Figure \n24). \nFor \nreturning members, lab access is \nrenewed after completing a safety \nretraining module that includes \nupdates \non \nthe \nEH&S \nprocedures. \nAdditionally, \nbefore accessing any potentially hazardous material or \nmachine, it is required that members review Standard \nOperating Procedures.

Proper PPE includes safety glasses, nitrile \ngloves, N95 respirators, steel toe boots/inserts, \nearplugs, and hard hats.

The Cp ratio is determined by the volume of \nwater displaced, divided by the product of the hull\u2019s \nmaximum cross-sectional area and the waterline length. \n(Figure 8). The righting arm is the horizontal distance \nfrom the center of gravity to the center of buoyancy \n(Sponberg, 2011). By increasing the righting arm, \nstability is strengthened through the righting moment. \nThe righting moment, determined from the righting arm, \nis the opposing moment created when\u2028the canoe begins \nto tilt or heel.  As the righting moment increases, the hull gains more resistance to overturning.

Using this data, each cross section was input into \nMicrosoft Excel\u2122 (Microsoft, 2013) and the submerged \nvolume was calculated by averaging adjacent cross \nsectional areas beneath the waterline and multiplying by \nth e distance between them.  The resultant buoyant force \nwas then applied upward at the midpoint between \nadjacent sections.  The weight of the canoe was assumed \nto be 170 lbs and was not distributed evenly, rather it \nwas distributed using a weighted system corresponding \nto the submerged volume of each section. This was done \nto better represent the actual weight distribution of the \ncanoe.  For transportation loading, eight upward point loads were distributed equally along the canoe to \nrepresent each person and for displaying the canoe; 2 point loads were used representing the stands.    \nUsing initial calculations for the buoyancy forces, it was determined that although all vertical forces \nwere in equilibrium, a resultant moment was present. However, based on the principals of mechanics, this \nresultant moment would mean the canoe was in constant rotational dynamic motion.  As this is not possible, \nminor corrections were made to the loads to maintain vertical equilibrium with no resultant moment. \nFor last year\u2019s Western Reserve, the 2 male scenario was determined to have the maximum moment \nand controlled the design.  However, the Bar-B-Qrete design team noticed that the locations of the 4 paddlers \nwere not representative of the actual race.

By moving these pairs of loads closer together, the 4 \nperson co-ed race becomes the controlling loading pattern with a moment of 454 lb-ft (Figure 11).

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant that writes proposals for the ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "prompt": "Write the development and testing section for an ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "output": "In previous years Western Kentucky University\u2019s canoe team used Type I Portland cement as the \nmain binder for mix design. Portland cement is an effective binder and popular in industry, but \nmanufacturing produces the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. Portland cement production makes up five \npercent of the world\u2019s total CO2 emissions, second only to power generation as the largest contributor \n(Hashim & Ishak, 2015). To reduce the canoe\u2019s carbon footprint, Bar-B-Qrete introduced a Portland cement \nalternative Ekkomaxx\u2122, which utilizes Class C fly ash (ASTM C618) and two liquid additives (ASTM \nC1157) to create a binder. The main objectives were creating an environmentally sustainable product and \ncreating a stronger compressive and flexural mix than its predecessor, Western Reserve. \nTo establish a baseline and secondary reinforcement, Bar-B-Qrete mix design team reproduced the \nstructural mix from Western Reserve. This baseline was chosen based on material availability and impressive \nperformance characteristics. Western Reserve structural mix (57.2 pcf, 2,680 psi) utilized Type I Portland \ncement (ASTM C150), VCAS 160 Micron-HS\u2122, and metakaolin (ASTM C618) as cementitious materials; \naggregates included a mixture of three foamed glass spheres, two glass bubbles and one type of ceramic \nspheres (Western Reserve, 2015). In addition, the mix contained water reducer, MasterGlenium\u00ae 7500 \n(ASTM C494), acrylic, Polyplex (ASTM C1438), and reinforcement, Nycon\u00ae-PVA RECS 15 (ASTM \nC1116) fibers. After a few failed attempts, Western Reserve\u2019s mix was replicated, having comparable \ncompressive strengths to the original. The next logical step was the \nremoval of Western Reserve\u2019s cementitious materials and the addition of \nEkkomaxx\u2122 Class C fly ash. CeraTech USA (CT USA), the manufacturer \nof Ekkomaxx\u2122, advised against the utilization of any admixtures, with air \nentrainer, MasterAir\u00ae AE 200 (ASTM C260) as the sole exemption (CT \nUSA, 2016). Adhering to this recommendation, all admixtures were \nremoved from Bar-B-Qrete\u2019s mix. Replacing these admixtures were \nMasterAir\u00ae AE 200, and Ekkomaxx\u2122 liquids: aL and mL.  Per CT USA, \nfly ash concrete requires a lower water to cementitious materials ratio and \nadvised not to exceed the ratio of 0.22 (CT USA, 2016). After all of these adjustments, the result was a very \ndry, soil-like mix, which was partially destroyed upon removal of the cylinder molds (Figure 12). In an \nattempt to saturate the mix, MasterGlenium\u00ae 7500 \nwas reintroduced, but was ineffective. The mix team \nturned to ADVA\u00ae Cast 555 (ASTM C494), a \ndonated high range water reducer. Adding ADVA\u00ae \nCast 555 improved workability without significantly \nincreasing the water to cementitious materials ratio. \nADVA\u00ae Cast 555 proportion was raised until its \nworkability benefit was exhausted, but still did not yield desired concrete workability. Western Reserve\u2019s \nacrylic, Polyplex, was introduced, but was soon replaced by Acryl\u00ae 60 (ASTM C1438), a donated acrylic. \nAcryl\u00ae 60 enhanced workability and delayed concrete setting.

While Bar-B-\nQrete attained high strength quickly, Western Reserve had a higher overall 28 day strength of 2,690 psi, \ncompared to Bar-B-Qrete\u2019s (1,980 psi). While Bar-B-Qrete  was lower in compressive strength, a lower unit \nweight of 51.8 pounds per cubic foot (pcf) was attained compared to Western Reserve\u2019s 57.2 pcf. \nAdditionally, the performance benefits of Ekkomaxx\u2122 fly ash concrete include corrosion resistance to salt, \nbetter protection of internal steel reinforcement, and enhanced durability (CT USA, 2016). \nTo meet milestone completion dates of the new fly ash structural mix, at least two trial batches were \ncreated per week.

The production of 1 ton of Portland cement equals approximately \n0.9 tons of CO2 emissions.

The existing male form consisted of alternating ribs of plywood and foam, with an exterior \npolyurethane coat, which provided a smooth finish. While the same form was used, ribs had separated and \ncracked. These imperfections were sanded off, filled will drywall joint compound, and re-sanded with fine \ngrit sandpaper to a smooth finish. Similar to Western Reserve, a layer of 7 mil industrial grade shrink-wrap \nwas added and heated to adhere to the canoe form. This shrink-wrap not only covered any minor \nimperfections, but allowed easy removal of the canoe from the male mold. \nIn order to ensure quality and efficiency during the canoe \npour, previous as well as new methods were utilized. Like Western \nReserve, all dry ingredients were batched prior to the canoe pour \nin separate batch containers. These dry components included \ncementitious materials, aggregates, fibers and dry additives. \nPipettes were added to the process to attain precise liquid \nmeasurements quickly, further expediting the mixing process and \nreducing fluid spills. Even with the pipette addition to the practice \ncanoe pour, the mix design team struggled to meet the concrete \ndemand of the placement team. In response, the mix design team \nincreased each batch size by three percent for the final canoe; this \nincreased production and reduced the team\u2019s exposure to the mixer \nand aggregate dust. This created a safer work environment for the \nteam and equalized the supply and demand of concrete. \nOne of the more time consuming tasks of the process was \nthe breaking up of the fibers.  When fibers are removed from the \nbag they tend to be in clumps, not in individual fibers.  This is not a significant issue in commercial concrete \napplications, however, in thin wall shells like a concrete canoe, a small clump of fibers can easily create a \nshear plane or stress concentration in the canoe, which must be avoided.  For the practice canoe pour, several \nteam members were given bags of fibers to break them up by simply manipulating them by hand until all of \nthe clumps were separated.  This process actually took \nclose to an hour for each bag.  For the final canoe pour, \nadditional efficiency was found through the use of \nhousehold blenders for breaking up the clumps of fibers \nreducing this time down to five minutes. From the \nprototype to the final canoe pour, this method reduced \nfiber prep time from two days to two hours, adding over \nan extra day worth of scheduled time for other pour \npreparation tasks. This not only expedited the pre-batching \nprocess, but helped \u201cfluff\u201d fibers (Figure 16) during the \nfinal canoe pour, allowing for a more homogeneous \ninclusion of the fibers into the concrete matrix. \nDuring the canoe pour, a Hobart HZ 60 mixer was \nused to mix the aggregates, liquids and admixtures of each \nbatch. In order to assure activation of all admixtures, each \nconcrete batch was mixed for ten minutes. Prior to placement of the first layer of concrete on the form, nylon \nlines were stretched across the canoe spaced from 6 to 8 inches, acting as a depth gauge for each concrete \nlayer. The thicknesses of the first and third layers were 0.095 inches, while the middle layer was 0.313 \ninches. During the placement of the first layer the concrete was placed on the form and troweled along the \ndepth gauges.

The team will \nimplement the quick release system that was \ndeveloped by the 2020 YSU Team due to its \nsatisfactory performance. This system consists of 2 \nthreaded steel rods that were inserted through the \nform cross sections with a single turnbuckle \nconnecting them. At the outside ends of the steel rods \nthere are contraction joints made of foam rubber. The \ncanoe will be demolded by tightening the turnbuckle, \nwhich causes the contraction joints to compress the \nform and pull it away from the canoe. This \ninnovative and sustainable release system allows for \nthe reuse of this form, which is ideal for protype \nproduction. The reusable form will decrease the cost \nof production and reduce the amount of production \nwaste.  \nThe Vikings used the dragon heads on the \nbow of their ships as a type of amulet to protect them \nagainst the evils at sea. These dragon heads also \nrepresented the status of the owners and were added \nto both intimidate and impress the enemy \n(Avaldsnes, 2020). The chosen design features a \ncrest in the center of the canoe, with two dragons on \neither side of the crest. The midnight blue base color \nof the canoe is meant to portray the dark mask of \nnight in which the Vikings would sail under to \nambush the enemy.  \nAs the lack of proper leadership was a \ndownfall for the Vikings, the YSU Concrete Canoe \nTeam sought to ensure that this weakness was \nnonexistent (Folger, 2017).

To \nensure \na \nhigh-quality \nproduct, \nthe \nQuality \nAssurance/Quality \nControl \n(QA/QC) \nDirector \ndeveloped an appropriate QA/QC plan. This plan \nwill be closely monitored to ensure that all project \nfacets are being completed with the highest quality \npossible. A leadership position, Sustainability & \nInnovation Director, was implemented this year to \nhigher prioritize the sustainability of the project. The \nYSU Concrete Canoe Team recognizes that in order \nto cause successful change, the issue of sustainability \nneeds to be acknowledged and prioritized. Hence, a \ndedicated position to research and recommend \npotential sustainability options for the canoe was \nassigned. This team member focused on reducing the \nunnecessary waste of the project and integrating \nmore recycled materials into the concrete mix.

A flatter \nbottom canoe would also negatively impact \nsecondary stability (while the canoe is in motion). As \na result, a wider canoe beam of 31 inches was used \nto increase overall stability, but have less of an effect \non speed (Winters, 1998).

These analyses ensure that the canoe can \nsurvive the trials of the competition.  \n \nMix Design \nThe 2021 Team set out to create a strong, \nlightweight mix with several goals in mind: creating \na sustainable mix to lower the environmental impact, \nhaving strength surpassing the design requirement, \nand to make it less dense than water in the oven dried \nstate. \n \nThe structural mix from the 2020 YSU \nConcrete Canoe was used as a baseline for Malice \nStriker. This mix contained Type I portland cement, \nCTS Komponent\u00ae, and ground granulated blast \nfurnace slag (GGBFS) for the cementitious \nmaterials. Various grades of Poraver\u00ae were used, \nalong with City Mix to fulfill the aggregate \nrequirements of the 2020 Request for Proposals \n(ASCE, 2019). Furthermore, K37 Glass Bubbles \nwere used as mineral filler. Additionally, air \nentrainer, high range water reducer, and set retarder \nwere incorporated. Finally, both polypropylene fiber \nand milled carbon fiber was used as the secondary \nreinforcement. \n \nThe 2021 Mix Design Team began by \nmaking alterations to ensure that the baseline mix \ncomplies with the requirements specified in the 2021 \nRequest for Proposals (ASCE, 2020). First, mineral \nfiller and Poraver\u00ae was removed from the mix and \nreplaced \nwith \nvarious \ngrades \nof \nPumice. \nAdditionally, milled carbon fiber was removed from \nthe mix since it was no longer rule compliant. \nFollowing this, an iterative process commenced to \ndetermine the optimal mix. \n \nWhite portland cement was chosen as the \nprimary binder to allow for added integral color to be \nmore prevalent. Metakaolin was added as a highly \nreactive pozzolan to increase both strength and \ndurability. Two moderate pozzolans, fly ash and \nGGBFS were investigated. Fly ash was removed \nfrom consideration due to the lack of quality control \navailable in the production because it is a byproduct \nof burning coal. This led to the phenomenon of mixes \nthat contained fly ash to exhibit inconsistent \nbehaviors. \nFurthermore, to reduce cracking, CTS \nKomponent\u00ae was added to the mix at 10% cement \nreplacement. This cementitious material created \nchemically prestressed concrete. This process was \nachieved by using CTS Komponent\u00ae causing the \nconcrete to expand during curing and the \nreinforcement counteracting this expansion by \ndeveloping tensile forces. To maintain equilibrium, \nthe concrete reacted equally with a compressive \nforce, thus, putting the concrete in a state of \ncompression through chemical means. This was \nconfirmed by performing four-point bending tests on \n3x3x12 inch beams with and without CTS \nKomponent\u00ae, according to ASTM C78 (2016).

This \nis done to ensure that the form shall be completed on \nschedule for place day. This decision was influenced \nby an incident that occurred previously in which the \nmanufacturer completed the form two months behind \nschedule. A total of 55 cross sections should be cut \nout of Masonite with the use of a CNC laser cutter, \nowned by YSU\u2019s art department.

To maintain \nalignment, a 1x2 inch steel tube can be fastened to \nthe table to act as a strongback. A notch is cut in the \nbottom of the centerline of each cross section, which \nallows them to sit on the strongback. A hole is drilled \nthrough each cross section to allow for a threaded rod \nto be inserted through it. These threaded rods are \nattached to each other with the use of a turnbuckle. \nAt four key locations, foam rubber inserts are added \nto the form to act as a contraction joint. To ensure \nuniform cross section spacing, the corresponding \nextruded foam sections are milled down by the \nthickness of the contraction joint. During the \ndemolding process, this system would be used to \ntighten the turnbuckle, causing the contraction joints \nto compress the form and allowing for easier form \nremoval. Joint wall compound will then be applied \nand sanded smooth to further reduce the number of \nimperfections in the form. This process should be \nrepeated until the form reaches the desired shape. \nFigure 11.

Ti\u2019Swaq\u2019s hull \nwas designed to eliminate the weaknesses of Vivace \nwhile improving on its strengths. \nThe desire to construct the hull true to its design \ndrove the decision to use a female mold. Vivace\u2019s hull \nhad poor tracking due to key features lost in placing, \nnamely the keel. The team believed that the issues that \narose the past year could be resolved by using a female \nmold, so the team chose to build off Vivace\u2019s hull \ndesign. \nTo preserve the stability of Vivace, similar \ndimensions of the beam and length were applied to \nTi\u2019Swaq. A one-inch increase in the beam accounted \nfor the use of a female mold due to a narrower interior \nafter placing. The hull height of 14 inches, shallow arc \nbottom, and sidewall outward angle of 3-degrees were \nalso preserved for paddler comfort and overall boat \nstability. Stability was evaluated using the metacentric \nheight and transverse water plane moment of inertia of \nthe canoe. The transverse moment of inertia of the \nwaterplane indicates the overturning resistance relative \nto the canoe width. \nWhile many aspects were reused to maintain \nstability, changes in symmetry, angle of entry, and the \nkeel were made to improve Ti\u2019Swaq\u2019s straight-line \nspeed. The beam of Ti\u2019Swaq is offset by one foot from \nthe center towards the stern. This asymmetric design \ncorrelates with a sharper entry angle that increases \nstraight-line speed (Figure 3).

The spreadsheet \nwould output all appropriate proportions for each \ndesired mix.  \nThe team analyzed baseline cementitious \nmaterials from Vivace and determined that all of them \nwould be retained because of their successful \nperformance as well as availability. The materials used \nincluded White Portland Cement Type I, Ground Blast \nFurnace Slag, Metakaolin, and Fly Ash Type F. White \nPortland Cement (ASTM C150) was used as the \nprimary cement for its aesthetic qualities and chemical \ncomposition that helps with early strength gain.

Adjustments were brought to last year\u2019s \ndesign with the use of Rhinoceros\u00ae, a 3D modeling \nsoftware. To improve the canoe\u2019s performances, chines \nand rocker at the stern were modified from Space \nOddity (2016). The combination of a flat and a \u201cV\u201d \nbottom resulted in the perfect compromise between \nstability and manoeuverability. LCC-22 was designed \nnarrower, making it faster in straight-lines. As a \nsmaller width directly impacts the freeboard, it was \nnecessary to increase the canoe\u2019s height to prevent \nwater from entering during races. The canoe\u2019s length \nwas also increased by 2 inches, making it easier for the \npaddlers to maintain a straight-line trajectory. To \nenhance paddlers comfort, notches were added in the \nmold preventing the mats from moving during races. \n \nTo simplify calculations, the canoe was \nconsidered as a beam with variable properties. Using a \nwater displacement of 510 lb, the team calculated the \nmaximum beam width, the freeboard height and the \nLoad \nWaterline \nLength \n(LWL). \nFrom \nthese \ncharacteristics, the Displacement-Length (D/L) ratio \nand the Beam-Draft (B/T) ratio shown on Figure 3 \nwere calculated to analyze LCC-22\u2019s hull shape \nproperties as they are two important criteria in boat \ndesign engineering. To allow a higher top speed, the \nD/L ratio and the B/T ratio, respectively indicating the \nhull\u2019s wave generation (Brewer, 1993) and the friction \ndrag caused by the total wet area, must be minimized. \nHowever, a compromise was necessary to ensure the \ncanoe\u2019s stability.

The time \nrequired for the canoe to rotate 90\u02da, shown in Table 9, \nwas an indicator of its manoeuverability. The \ncomparison between Borealis (2012)\u2019s and LCC-22\u2019s \nresults demonstrated that this indicator is influenced by \nthe D/L ratio.

This hull was originally designed using Prolines 8\u2122 \nand evaluated in a flume to find approximate speed and buoyancy; \nhowever, issues were identified in the bow. The canoe seemed to \nroll over the wakes of other boats, making it difficult to pick up \nspeed in the straightaways. If the front of the canoe was sharpened \nso that it would cut through instead of bulldozing the water, it could \ngive Accursed a chance to outrun the competition. This was \naccomplished by cutting and sanding down the front section of the \nMon-Row mold to a more gradual taper from the bow to the hull, \nwhile also bringing the tip of the bow to a point. Time trials with \nthe contemporary design were taken and averaged, then compared \nto old Mon-Row average practice times (Table 3). This data showed \nthat the new design did help to increase speed in the sprints.  The \nrest of the Mon-Row mold was left unmodified since it is a shorter, rounded hull, which is optimal for balancing \nmaneuverability and straight-line speed. The weight of the canoe was also a consideration for its slower sprint \nspeed. By changing the depth of the hull from 16 in. to 14 in., the volume of the canoe was significantly \ndecreased. The dimensions of the hull are 20 ft. in length, 27 in. at the maximum width, 14 in. in depth, 2/5 in. \nin average thickness, a 5.0 in. \nstern, and a 4.3 in. bow. The unit \nweight of the canoe was \ndesigned to be lower than 62.4 \npcf, permitting the removal of \nbulkheads. The team ultimately \ndecided to add bulkheads to \nincrease the safety factor for \nswamp test floatation. \n  The lighter nature of \nthe mix opened the door for \npotential cracks and weaknesses \nthroughout the hull. The team decided to make a three-layer boat with the contingency of adding an extra layer \nif the practice canoe had issues. The primary and secondary reinforcement (Table 4) consisted of EIFS \nfiberglass mesh which was picked for offset shearing in the hull. This mesh has a percent open area well above \nthe minimum 40%. Seven pretensioned cables were placed longitudinally (one along the bottom and three on \neach side) inside the second layer of concrete to increase the overall flexural strength of the hull. The second \nlayer spaced the layers of mesh farther apart, away from the neutral axis. Required paddler locations were not \nstated in the 2023 Request for Proposals (RFP), so locations were set by the team to design general load cases. \nIt seemed most comfortable for our paddlers to sit roughly 4 ft and 16 ft. from the bow.

The bottom of the beam also \nhad triangular distributed loads for buoyancy forces \nranging from 86 lb/ft for coed to 46 lb/ft for female at the peak of the triangle. The paddlers\u2019 weights were \nadded as point loads at their respective locations. An Excel\u2122 spreadsheet was used to determine the shear and \nbending moment diagrams, calculating maximum shear, moment, and stresses for each load case (Figure 6). \nThese diagrams gave the knowledge needed to design the mix and canoe accordingly. The maximum shear \nwas found to be 170 lb and the maximum moment was found to be 600 lb-ft. The highest compressive stress \ncame from the simply supported load case at 160 psi, \nwhile the simply supported load case had the highest \nflexural stress at 430 psi (Table 5). \nPunching shear differs from one-way shear \nbecause the punching force acts in multiple dimensions in \nan isolated area, like forcing a paddler\u2019s knee through a 4 \nin. x 4 in. area.

The ultimate shear (Vu) and the \nnominal shear were then calculated and checked (Table 6). \nThe ultimate shear was calculated to be 35 psi. Following \nACI 318-14 section 11.11.2.2 for maximum pre-stressed \nshear, the critical point was selected as the location of the \nhighest shear, which is also the location of the paddler in \nthe two-male load \ncase. This indicates \nthat \nthe \ncanoe \nwould \npass \npunching \nshear \nusing the minimum \ncompressive strength requirements of the two-male load case. Since the \ntwo-paddler load case passed punching shear at the minimum \nrequirement of 16 psi compressive strength, the mix design baseline mix of 2,290 psi compressive strength \nwas conservative enough to confirm that punching shear was not a concern for the canoe in all load cases.  \nUsing the worst-case scenarios from the"}

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide \nproduction was reduced for months to mitigate the spread of the \ncoronavirus. Not only did this shutdown reduce the supply of needed \nproducts, but it also reduced the workforce, affecting shipping times on \nmix products. The team decided that it would be best to test the materials that were readily available and \nadhered to the new rules from ASCE. The final selection was made from \nthose products as to not risk delays in shipping times. This choice was \nbeneficial, reducing total shipping costs while maintaining compliance to \nthe rules. Due to this approach, supply chain delays did not affect the team\u2019s \nschedule. \nPreviously, many designs began with a preceding canoe mix but with \nthe new rules, the mix needed to be made from scratch. The main standard \nwhich affected the mix was ASTM C150, which limited the Portland cement \nquantity to less 30% of cementitious materials (by mass) that could be used \nin the mix. The cementitious materials used for Accursed included VCAS\u2122 \n160 (ASTM C618, C1240) and PowerPozz\u2122 Metakaolin (ASTM C618), \nwhich helped accommodate the cement reduction and lowered the composite weight of the cementitious \nmaterials. The team\u2019s choice for binders was determined by the materials readily \navailable and the quantities were determined by adjusting ratios that allowed for \nhigh compressive strength and did not require excessive amounts of water. \nWhen choosing admixtures, they were selected from previous years\u2019 \nsupply to reduce costs by roughly $650 and not delay weekly goals. ADVA\u00ae \nCast 555 (ASTM C494) was chosen since it increased workability without \nhindering strength and MasterAir\u00aeAE 200 (ASTM C260) provided air \nentrainment and additional workability. PREVent-C\u2122 (ASTM C494) was also \nincluded to reduce shrinkage and cracking, which is necessary when removing \nthe canoe from the male mold. By using Nycon\u00ae (ASTM C1116) fibers instead \nof hemp, the team was able to reduce labor by approximately three hours. \nFigure 7: Making Cylinders \nFigure 8: Pre-batching Cementitious \nFigure 9: Pre-Batching Aggregate \nFigure 10: Preparing Admixtures \n \n \n \n9\nDue to the removal of the ASTM C330 aggregate requirement, the team began to test glass spheres to \nuse as the sole aggregate. This year\u2019s gradation requirement was set as a means of regulating the sizes of \naggregates and a minimum of 30% (by volume) was required for the overall mix volume. This minimum gave  \nenough room for the strength requirements to be met. The team abandoned Riverlite\u00ae as the primary aggregate \nand instead used glass spheres as the only aggregate. This allowed the team to avoid sieving by using different \nparticle sizes of AGSCO\u00a9 Foamed \nGlass Spheres that can be bought in \nspecific sizes (Table 7). These values \nwere found following ASTM C128. \nSieving is both labor-intensive and \nposes a safety risk due to dust, so the \nability to omit this task entirely proved \nto be a valuable decision. The benefits of glass spheres are that they are extremely lightweight, allowing the \nteam to meet mix unit weight goals of being less dense than water. This idea was actualized after numerous \nattempts and allowed the removal of bulkheads from the design. One obstacle in making the selection was the \nrestrictions placed on the mix criteria for this year\u2019s competition.  \nInitially, four mixes would be made per week (Figure 9). After each mix was completed, the mixes \nwere set to rest for a period of seven days, a compressive strength test in compliance with ASTM C39 was \nperformed, and information collected was then input into a Microsoft Excel\u2122 spreadsheet. This helped track \nthe mix performance. This Microsoft Excel\u2122 sheet was automated which saved about 14 hours compared to \nhand calculations.  \n  \nTable 8 shows the distribution of \neach individual components in the mix. \nPrimary reinforcements used for the \nflexural plates included braided steel \ncable reinforcement and EIFS fiberglass \nmesh. These were chosen due to cost \nefficiency, having a pre-existing supply, \nand the fact that they have been proven \neffective through multiple national \ncompetitions. These flexural plates were \nmade with the following: three concrete \nlayers, two steel cables after the first \nconcrete layer, and a layer of mesh \nbetween \neach \nlayer. \nThis \nis \nrepresentative \nof \nthe \ncanoe \nreinforcement scheme.  \nAfter a total of 22 mixes, the \nfinal mix was chosen. This mix design had a unit weight of 60.9 pcf, less than the 62.4 pcf for water that was \nneeded to allow floatation without bulkheads. The 28-day compressive strength was 2,100 psi. The 7-day \ncomposite flexural strength was 510 psi (ASTM C78), meeting the flexural and compressive strength \nrequirements set during"}

Accursed \nhas an advantage learning from these national competitors, so WKU\u2019s successful approach can continue to \ndevelop. While value is optimizing time, money, and resources, Accursed takes a unique approach to have the \ngreatest opportunity for success against teams with larger resources. The order of priority for WKU is this: \nTechnical Proposal, Technical Presentation, Final Product Prototype, and Prototype Performance \nDemonstration. The Technical Proposal is the great equalizer, meaning it requires minimal cost to produce, \nonly time. Additionally, this section sets the tone as the first submission, since a quality paper can boost team \nmorale before the regional symposium. Additionally, since the judges can refer to the Proposal during the \nPresentation Q&A, it\u2019s important to reduce deficiencies in the Proposal. The next important portion is the \nTechnical Presentation; it also has minimal cost and takes only time to create and practice. After the \nPresentation is the Final Product Prototype, which costs more than \nthe Proposal or Presentation to create the display aesthetics but \nallows creativity without the pressures of a live presentation. \nPrototype Performance is very important but is valued last due to \npaddling randomness; missing a buoy, collisions, a structural \nissue, or weather cancellations could cost the team significant \npoints. To reduce some randomness, modifying the existing hull \nyearly can improve race performance; however, redesigning the \nentire hull yearly would be unfeasible due to the excessive cost.  \nTo set the tone for regionals, the Project Proposal was started in the fall semester to get a jump start on \nthe editing and review process over winter break. Each team member was given a Proposal section to compile \nwhile reviewing the remaining sections. Using Microsoft Word\u2122\u2019s online feature, team members were able \nto edit and review each other instantly even though they were at home for break. Since it did not impact the \ncanoe budget, the Project Proposal was reviewed and edited multiple times to first add bulk content, then \nremove deductions, and lastly fine tune. \nFor the Technical Presentation, the team started by selecting presenters and compiling the presentation, \nemphasizing the mix design, pour day, paddling and any innovations of this year\u2019s canoe. After compiling \nslides, the presenters began practicing publicly to get used to an audience and questions. The Proposal was \nreviewed by team members to ask questions for presenters. The team at first had issues remembering their \nspeaking parts and answers, but soon felt comfortable in front of an audience. At this point, the presenters \npracticed daily together to ensure content and confidence was retained.

In contrast, after shale is mined it \nneeds an expanding process. However, the most \nimportant fact about pumice is its lower specific \ngravity that creates less dense concrete. Pumice also \nhas the advantage of internally curing concrete which \nresults in improved hydration, reduced early \ncracking, and improved durability (ACI 2016). \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nTable 2.

This mix was hard enough to sand within an \nhour and developed 28-day equivalent strength in 24 \nhours.

In the \nfinalized design, two spiders were added as outer \ninlays to the front of the canoe to impose fear in our \nopponents. The inlay contains a terrifying large \nwhite spider. The white spider is a tribute to the  \ndeadly, white, female widow spider known as \nLatrodectus Pallidus. The red webs while not \ncoinciding with the actual color of a spider webs \nbrings a uniqueness to the canoe and makes the \ndesign look enticing.  \nWhile the female Latrodectus Pallidus \ncontinually hunts for food, its male counterpart stops \neating when it reaches maturity and starts to look for \na mate (Spider Identifications 2022). Since the \nLatrodectus Pallidus female is a leader with all the \ncontrol over the male, the YSU team looked to assign \nmultiple lead positions inspired by the Latrodectus \nPallidus. The hierarchy that has been used in \nprevious years known as matrix style organization is \nstill efficient and was incorporated by this year\u2019s \nteam. The matrix style organization allows for people \nto participate in all parts of the canoe providing: team \ncommunication, \nposition \nflexibility, \nproject \nsustainability, and cross training. The Quality \nAssurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) \nDirector \ndeveloped a proper QA/QC plan to produce a high-\nquality product. It is essential that the plan be \nmeticulously kept track of to ensure that every part \nof the project is being held to the highest standard. \nNewly implemented last year, the leadership position \nof Sustainability Lead was assigned to create \nsustainable solutions to pertinent problems. Having \ndifficulty with the sustainability aspect of past \ncanoes, this leadership role was administered to \nimprove the sustainability of the project. The \nposition involved a dedicated work ethic to research \nand \nimplement \nsustainable \npractices. \nThe \nSustainability Lead was very involved with the mix \ndesign process in an effort to reduce waste of \nmaterials and incorporate recycled and sustainable \nmaterials. The Sustainability Lead proved to be vital \nfor this year\u2019s canoe, Latrodectus. \nThe Safety Director of the YSU Concrete \nCanoe had an extraordinarily large challenge of \ndealing with the uncertainty regarding the COVID-\n19 pandemic. The team\u2019s top priority is the safety of \nits members which was accomplished by following \nall of the university\u2019s COVID-19 guidelines. The \nYSU Concrete Canoe Team is committed to keeping \neveryone on the team and at the university safe. \nWith the dedication and bold new ideas from \nthe new and old team members the 2022 YSU \nConcrete Canoe Team was able to develop an \nalluring spider theme that gives appreciation to one \nof the most feared creatures in the world. The 2022 \nYSU Concrete Canoe Team is honored to present \nLatrodectus. \n \n3 \n \nASCE Student Chapter Profile  \nYoungstown State University is known as a \ncomprehensive urban research university that was \nfounded in 1908 located in downtown Youngstown, \nOhio. The long participation of the YSU ASCE \nStudent Chapter first started in 1960 and is proudly \nbeing carried on by approximately 20 student \nmembers. The commitment of the YSU ASCE team \nis seen by its repeated attendance at the regional \nsymposiums since 2002. There is a rich history \nwithin the YSU ASCE team seen by the many \npodium places and awards. The concrete canoe team \nhas qualified for the national competition 5 times. At \nthe regional level the YSU concrete canoe team \nplaced third, second, first, second, and first in the \n2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021 competitions, \nrespectively. At the society-wide level, the team \nplaced fifth in 2018, along with winning the \ninnovation award. Furthermore, the team placed \nsecond at the society-wide competition in 2021. The \n2021 second place society-wide team is proudly \nshown below in Figure 1.  \n \nFigure 1. 2021 Society-Wide Team \nIn addition, YSU has also competed in the steel \nbridge competition. The team has been very \nsuccessful over the years qualifying for the national \ncompetition 16 times. The highest finish to date has \nbeen 3rd place overall in 2019 and 2021.  \nThe important mission statement that YSU \nASCE enforces is making the transition from student \nto engineering professional as smooth as possible. \nThe purpose of the chapter is to give student \nengineers more professional expertise, meet monthly \n(even during the COVID-19 pandemic), increase \nstudent social experience, and increase community \ninvolvement.  \nA primary focus and goal of the YSU ASCE \nteam was to introduce a professional atmosphere and \ncommunication. This was done through guest \nspeakers. One guest speaker was Luis Vindel, a \nformer ASCE member who spoke about his \nexperience transitioning from a student to a \nprofessional at an engineering firm. The floor was \nopen to questions from the students to gather \nguidance on any concerns they had. This event took \nplace on November 10, 2021, and Luis can be found \nspeaking in Figure 2, below.  \n \nFigure 2. ASCE Guest Speaker Luis Vindel \nThe second goal of having monthly meetings, \neven through the COVID-19 pandemic, was a \nchallenge that the team was able to overcome. With \nsafety measures in place, the team was able to meet \nand discuss the important project updates of the \nconcrete canoe and the upcoming events for ASCE. \nFigure 3, below, shows the mask guidelines being \nfollowed and the students collaborating on the \nconcrete canoe project. \n \nFigure 3. Concrete Canoe Members Collaborating \n \nThe third and final goal of YSU ASCE was \nto increase the student social experience since many \nof this year\u2019s participants were brand new to the \nstudent chapter. As seen  in Figure 4, below, a social \nevent was held where the team members could form \nfriendships and boost overall morale. Additional \nsocial events were also held throughout the year. \n \nFigure 4.

It incorporates three and two \ninch rockers in the bow and stern, respectively, \ngreatly improving maneuverability with little to no \nimpact on top speed. Based on the size of the trailer \nused to transport the canoe, the 20 foot long canoe is \nan ideal length. Since the top speed increases with \nlength, maximizing this length provides a faster \ncanoe. This canoe includes a shallow arch design \nallowing for less wetted surface area as opposed to a \nflatter bottom, which decreases drag.  \nOverall, the team felt that the use of this \ndesign allowed team members to focus more on \npaddling and on new, innovative features of the \ncanoe.

This mix had the following goals: \nexceeding all strength requirements, being less dense \nthan water, and having a lower carbon footprint.  \n \nThe structural mix from the 2019 YSU \nConcrete Canoe was used as a baseline for \nLatrodectus. This mix contained Type I portland \ncement, CTS Komponent\u00ae, metakaolin, and ground \ngranulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) for the \ncementitious materials. Various grades of Poraver\u00ae \nwere used, along with expanded shale to fulfill the \n \n8 \n \naggregate requirements of the 2019 Rules and \nRegulations (ASCE 2018). Additionally, high range \nwater reducer, latex, and set retarder were \nincorporated. Finally, polypropylene fibers were \nused as secondary reinforcement. \n \nThe 2022 \nMix Design Team \nbegan by making \nalterations to the \nbaseline mix to \nensure \nthat \nit \ncomplies with the \nrequirements \nspecified in the \n2022 Request for \nProposals (RFP) \n(ASCE \n2021). \nFirst, \nexpanded \nshale \nwas \nremoved from the \nmix and replaced \nwith various grades of pumice. Pumice replaced \nexpanded shale because it is a less dense ASTM \nC330 compliant aggregate. In addition, the ASTM \nC330 compliant pumice was proportioned at a rate \nslightly more than 50% of the aggregate volume to \nensure RFP compliance. In addition, the total \naggregate volume was reduced to slightly more than \n30% of the concrete volume to also ensure RFP \ncompliance. The remaining volume difference \nbetween aggregate was replaced with the less dense \n3M\u2122 K37 Glass Bubbles as mineral filler. This \nchange significantly reduced the density of the \nconcrete mix. The team removed latex since its use \nis restricted by the RFP. The team included an air \nentraining admixture to mimic the air entraining \nproperties of latex. Following this, an iterative \nprocess commenced to determine the optimal mix. \n \nGray portland cement was chosen as the \nprimary binder to allow for a dark base color. \nMetakaolin was chosen as the highly reactive \npozzolan to increase strength and durability. \nGGBFS, a moderate pozzolan, was chosen over fly \nash because of its ability to achieve consistent \nresults.  \n \nFurthermore, CTS Komponent\u00ae was added \nto the mix at 10% cement replacement to reduce \ncracking. This \ncementitious material creates \nchemically prestressed concrete. CTS Komponent\u00ae \ncauses the concrete to expand during curing and the \nreinforcement counteracts this by going into tension. \nTo maintain equilibrium, the concrete reacts with an \nequal compressive force, thus, putting the concrete in \ncompression via a chemical means. This was \nconfirmed by"}

To begin, 50% of the \naggregate volume was required to meet ASTM C330 \nor be recycled concrete aggregate (RCA). The team \ninvestigated expanded shale, pumice, and RCA \nwhich met these requirements. Ultimately, pumice \nwas chosen because it provided lighter, more \nconsistent mixes than expanded shale or RCA. In \naddition, pumice has a lower environmental impact \nthan expanded shale. This is because expanded shale \nrequires a heating process that uses fossil fuels, while \npumice does not (Norlite LLC, 2021). After this, the \nteam researched viable options for the remaining \nportion of the aggregate. Ultimately, Poraver\u00ae was \nused because it is lightweight and has consistent \nproperties.

By \nincreasing the amount of fine aggregate, there is \nmore surface area to cover since the aggregate tends \nto pack well. A larger grain size has less surface area \nand does not pack well. In addition, the ability to \ntrowel the concrete smooth is diminished as larger \naggregate rolls under the trowel. The team optimized \nthis by using a broad distribution of aggregate and \nmineral filler. Fine material helps to fill the voids \ncreated by the larger aggregate resulting in a lower \nwater to cementitious ratio as compared to using only \nfine aggregate. The final aggregate and mineral filler \nblend (by mass) can be seen in Figure 9. \nFigure 8. Making Test Mixes \n \n9 \n \n \nFigure 9.

All admixtures were incorporated at the \nmanufacturers recommended dosages. \n \nSecondary reinforcement was incorporated \nvia fibers. Three types of fibers were tested including \npolypropylene, fiberglass, and basalt. Four-point \nbending tests were performed on 3\u201dx3\u201dx12\u201d beam \nspecimens containing different fibers.

A male form was chosen \nbecause it allowed the team to utilize prestress \ntendons. The male form gives an area to bear over \nwhile they are tightened on place day. On the other \nhand, female forms would require the team to use \npost-tensioned tendons which requires voids to be \nleft in the canoe. The prestress tendon technique has \nbeen successfully implemented by the YSU Concrete \nCanoe Team for over a decade and previous \nexperience has proven this method to be effective. \nPlace Day Preparation: Upon arrival of the form, \nthe team had to assemble it due to shipping \nlimitations. The form was assembled on a \nprefabricated table. The three pieces were bonded by \nthe means of a liquid adhesive. Drywall compound \nwas used to fill the seam between the three segments. \nAfter the drywall compound dried, the team sanded \nit until smooth. Then a water-based polyurethane \nwas used to provide a smooth surface with no ridges. \nA \nsmall \nportion \nof \nthe bottom \nof the form \nhad to be cut \nout to ensure \na \nslightly \noversized \nslot that fit \nover \nthe \nstrongback. The strongback prevents the form from \nshifting or moving during place day. This \nmechanism consists of a one by two-inch steel tube \nbolted to the table. With the form in place and \nsecured, the team then chose the images to use as \ngraphical inlays on the canoe. After the images were \nchosen and approved, they were projected onto a \nlarge wall. Cosplay craft foam was attached to the \nwall allowing for the image to be traced accurately. \nThe team traced the image carefully and began the \nprocess of cutting it out creating inlay placeholders. \nNext, the placeholders were adhered to the form \n(Figure 12). Each place holder\u2019s thickness was the \nsame as the first layer of concrete, allowing for \nreinforcement to be placed appropriately and in turn \neliminating any weak spots in the canoe.

This gunwale \nstrip acted as a guide to ensure uniform thickness. \nThe team chose plastic over other materials because \nit was water resistant, and the strips would not warp \nand expand when exposed to water. Next, 1/8 inch \nthick plastic strips were attached to the form with \npush pins and nails.

A humidifier was used to ensure that the \ncanoe remained saturated at 100% humidity for 7 \ndays, at which point the concrete had reached the \nmajority of its strength.  \nFinishing: After the curing process was completed, \nthe tent was removed, and wet sanding began. Wet \nsanding was preferred over dry sanding because it \ndoes not expose the team members to concrete dust. \nThe outside of the canoe was sanded smooth using \nwet sanding blocks to 400 grit. The exterior inlays \nplace holders were taken out and the void was filled \nwith rapid set concrete. The rapid set concrete cures \nwithin one hour which allowed the team members to \nsand the inlay to 400 grit. Lastly, the exterior of the \ncanoe was sanded up to 3,500 grit. After the outside \nwas sanded, the canoe was removed from the table \nand demolded. Once the form was removed from the \ncanoe, the team filled in the void created by the inlay \nwith rapid set concrete. Sanding continued on the \ninside of the canoe.

This \nindividual was responsible for researching and \ninforming other team members about sustainable and \ninnovative practices that can be implemented in the \nproject. \nOne of the most impactful ways to improve \nthe environmental sustainability of the project is \nchoosing to use materials that have a smaller carbon \nfootprint. The first of these was the use of slag \ncement to replace a portion of portland cement. \nUnlike portland cement, slag cement is a recycled \nmaterial, a byproduct of iron production. Slag also \ntakes nearly 90% less energy to produce than its \ncounterpart \n(Slag \nCement). \nCSA \n(Calcium \nSulfoaluminate) cement was also used for the \naesthetics mix. CSA cement is more sustainable than \nportland cement, as it is fired at a much lower \ntemperature (Phaire 2006). Another recycled \ncomponent was Poraver expanded glass. The \ncompany uses post-consumer recycled glass to make \nthe aggregate. This uses much less energy than \nhaving to mine material, which is necessary in the \nproduction of other aggregates, such as perlite, \nexpanded shale, and vermiculite. Steel, the most \nrecycled material in the world, was used for \nprestressing (AISC 2020).  \nA large factor in the economic sustainability \nof the project was the reuse and recycling of the \nmaterials. Some of these were lumber, the canoe \nstands, and gunwale guides. Another way to help cut \nback was the use of a male form over a female form \nwhich reduces the amount of foam used to \nmanufacture the form.     \nAlong with environmental and economic \nsustainability, the team also used a matrix style of \norganization to ensure social sustainability. Multiple \nteam leaders had different responsibilities, and all \nmembers took part in completing the necessary tasks. \nEveryone working together helped improve team \ncollaboration throughout the year. Another benefit of \nthis was the knowledge and experience passed down \nfrom more experienced members.  \nHealth and Safety \nGeneral Safety: With the safety of all members \nbeing a prominent priority throughout the project, a \nSafety Director was assigned and underwent \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA) training. This training ensured potential \nworkplace hazards would be identified and properly \nhandled. The Safety Director was tasked with \nverifying that all equipment was compliant with \nsafety standards and used properly by team \nmembers. They also required members to use \npersonal protective equipment (PPE), including \nrespirator \nmasks, \ngloves, \nand \ngoggles, \nthroughout \nthe project.

The Safety director kept a \nrecord of all the Safety Data Sheets by storing them \nin a binder for quick access. They also informed the \nteam of proper safety measures while using materials \nand equipment. \nThe program also included stop-work \nauthority for all team members and everyone was \nresponsible for reporting safety incidents.

The Safety Director was \ntasked with enforcing the guidelines and monitoring \nany new policies. In accordance with university \nguidelines, members performed self-assessments, \nincluding taking body temperatures and checking for \nsymptoms, prior to coming to campus. Members \nstayed home if their temperature was too high, they \nwere experiencing symptoms, or came in close \ncontact with someone who tested positive.  \nIn addition, face coverings were required to \nbe worn at all times, and team members were \nphysically distanced when practical. Sanitation \nstations equipped with hand sanitizer and table \ndisinfectant are also located outside all classrooms \nand labs on campus, thus members were required to \nsanitize work areas before and after they were used \n(Figure 19).

The Concrete Canoe Competition is an embodiment of \nthis architectural style through which concrete is applied in a nontraditional manner to create floating works of \nart. Influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright and the Competition\u2019s ideals, the 2017 University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison \n(UW-Madison) Concrete Canoe Team has focused on pushing concrete and its constituent components beyond \ntheir primal forms to produce a unique canoe that that is competitive at the national level. Drawing aesthetic \ninspiration from the chevron stained glass windows that accentuate many of Wright\u2019s Prairie style homes, the \nUW-Madison Concrete Canoe Team is proud to introduce its 2017 entry, Prairie Chevron.  \nSimilar to many of the members that form the 2017 UW-Madison Concrete Canoe Team, Frank Lloyd Wright \nbegan his renowned career at the University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison \nas a student of civil engineering. Located in Madison, Wisconsin, the \nUniversity of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison remains committed to the guidance \nof over 64,000 students and scholars alike, encouraging them to \nexplore new and existing methods, ideas, and materials that transcend \npreconceived traditions (UW-Board of Regents 2016).  \nAs a member of the Great Lakes Student Conference, the UW-Madison \nConcrete Canoe Team has enjoyed considerable success in recent \nyears.

The consistent \nchemical composition and tightly controlled particle size \ndistribution result in highly reactive and superior quality \npozzolans for concrete applications.   \n \nCurrently, the VCAS\u2122 patented technology produces \nwhite pozzolans in three grades, VCAS-140, VCAS-160 \nand VCAS-Ultra200, engineered with fineness tailored \nfor the demands of the applications as described in this \ntechnical summary. \n \n \n \nUnlike silica fume, coal fly ash, ground granulated blast \nfurnace slag, and other by-products, VCAS\u2122 White \nPozzolans are free of iron, manganese, and other \nundesirable color-inducing impurities, making them \nideally suited for all applications using white cement \nand in decorative and pigmented concrete.  \n \nVCAS\u2122 pozzolans are value-added supplementary \ncementing materials that exhibit pozzolanic activity \ncomparable to silica fume and metakaolin when tested \nin accordance with ASTM C618 and ASTM C1240.  \nVCAS\u2122 pozzolans react with calcium hydroxide \nproduced during the hydration of Portland cement to \nform additional cementitious compounds such as \ncalcium silicate and alumino-silicate hydrates.  \nPozzolans are widely used in cement and concrete \ntechnology to increase concrete strength, density, and \nresistance to chemical attack as well as control \nefflorescence. \n \n \n \nChemically, VCAS\u2122 pozzolans are comprised largely \nof oxides of silicon, aluminum and calcium with no \ndeleterious impurities.  The CaO-SiO2-Al2O3 \nproportions, the low alkali metal content, and the amor-\nphous structure are ideal for a pozzolanic additive in \nhydraulic concrete.  The low iron content makes them \nparticularly well suited for applications using white \ncement, such as mortars, stuccos, terrazzo, artificial \nstone, and cast-in-place or precast concrete products. \n \n \nTernary diagram (CaO-SiO2-Al2O3) for the composition of VCAS\u2122 \npozzolans relative to Portland cement and the common pozzolans. \n \n \nVCAS\u2122 pozzolans have superior powder handling \ncompared with silica fume and metakaolin.

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant that writes proposals for the ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "prompt": "Write the development and testing section for an ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "output": "Goals have been identified by the \nUnited Nations Environment Programme to improve \nglobal conditions in various aspects. Goal 13 is \nfocused on climate action and intends to combat \nincreased \nextreme \nweather \nevents, \nreduced \nagricultural yields, and water insecurities [37].  \nThese are just some of the major burdens the world \nis expected to face in the coming decades, and the \neffects will only worsen with time. Concrete \nproduction is a major contributor to climate change, \nbeing responsible for approximately 8% of global \ncarbon dioxide emissions [38]. It is therefore vital \nthat the carbon impacts from concrete are addressed \nto reduce the potential issues raised by the UN \nEnvironmental Programme. The Mines Concrete \nCanoe Team has made it a priority to design a more \nenvironmentally sustainable concrete mix. By \npartially replacing portland cement with hydrated \nlime, carbon emissions were reduced. Hydrated lime \nalso absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere \nduring curing, creating a small-scale carbon \nsequestration process  [39]. \nAnother sustainable aspect of the mix design \nis the inclusion of Poraver expanded glass \naggregates, a material produced from recycled waste \nglass. One advantage of Poraver is the ability to reuse \nglass that cannot otherwise be economically \nrepurposed as container glass [40], preventing it \nfrom being disposed of. This gives Poraver both \nenvironmental and economic advantages over virgin \nmaterial. \nThe manufacturing of steel inevitably \nproduces waste with material that cannot be refined, \nof which slag is a major constituent. Slag has little to \nno economic value after everything has been \nextracted, but due to the high content of calcium and \nsilicates, it can be repurposed in a concrete mix as a \ncementitious material. This prevents the waste \nbyproduct of steel production from being disposed of  \n[41], diverting material from landfills. \nFinally, \nthe \nmost \ngroundbreaking \nsustainability measure is the reusability of the foam \nmold for canoe"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant that writes proposals for the ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "prompt": "Write the construction section for an ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "output": ". Two canoes were cast \nusing the same mold, reducing the waste generated \nfrom canoe manufacturing. Expanded polystyrene \nfoam, the type used in the canoe form, is estimated \nto take up about 30% of space in all landfills [42]. \nSince less foam is required overall, this reduces the  \n 15 \n \n \n \nColorado School of Mines \namount of landfill material generated, which is more \nenvironmentally \nsustainable. \nAlthough \nCNC \nmachines require high amounts of energy, which \ncontribute to greenhouse gas emissions, this is offset \nby a reduction in emissions caused by material \nproduction and transportation.  \nTypically, concrete canoe teams spend \nhundreds of hours sanding canoes for an extremely \nsmooth finish  [43]. Sterrennacht did a small amount \nof sanding on the canoe because of the significant \ntime it would require and the potential environmental \nand safety risks associated with particulate \ngeneration [44] [45]. To decrease the sanding of \nconcrete, the team sanded the foam mold for 20 \nperson-hours to get rid of bumps and imperfections \nthat would have shown up on the interior of the \ncanoe. However, some imperfections were too large \nto be fixed by sanding the mold, so 15 person-hours \nof concrete sanding occurred on the interior of the \ncanoe. Roughness present from not sanding the \noutside of the canoe was minimized by using a \nsmooth aesthetic mix design. The team determined \nthat the loss in hydrodynamic performance was \noutweighed by sustainability advantages and \ndecreased labor costs derived from not sanding.  \nImprovements \nOne of the key ways the team verified and \nimproved processes was through the production of a \nfull-scale preliminary canoe. This allowed the team \nto iterate methods and processes for the prototype \ncanoe.  \nDuring the first pour day, the canoe suffered from \ndelamination due to concrete curing prior to batching \nbeing ready for the subsequent section. To solve this \nissue, hydration control was added to the mix. By \nslowing the set time, hydration control allowed for \nadequate batching time between layers. In addition \nto hydration control, pre-batching of cementitious \nmaterials \nand \naggregate \nblends \nwas \nalso \nimplemented to decrease the time required for \nbatching on pour day. This improvement reduced \ntotal pour time from 15 to 10 hours and decreased the \nrisk of delamination. \nQA/QC methods also evolved, after realizing that \nthe installation and removal of the QC strings \npartially contributed to the formation of cold joints. \nFor the prototype canoe, these \nstrings were never embedded \ninto concrete, preventing the \nformation of cold joints due to \nincomplete filling of gaps left \nbehind by string removal.  \nLastly, the team also \nrealized \nthe \nadvantages \nbrought by shaping the basalt reinforcement prior to \nthe pour day. During the preliminary canoe pour, \nbasalt mesh was cut on-site, eliminating reinforce-\nment continuity and introducing a significant time \ngap between the placement of structural layers. By \nshaping the basalt mesh prior to pour day, installation \ntime and risk of delamination were decreased. \nOne of the best practices implemented by the \nteam this year was the organizational structure.

After consulting with veteran \npaddlers, the team concluded that adding a flat \nbottom to the canoe design was an attractive option, \nas it presented the possibility of reducing tipping \nmotion and improving overall stability. Several hull \ndesigns were developed and compared with respect \nto their coefficient values. The goal was to provide a \nbalanced canoe that would perform well in all \nscenarios, which include low-speed sharp turns and \ncontinuous high-speed straightaways.  \nTANAM\u00c1\u2019s hull retained crucial design \ncharacteristics from Amurallada\u2019s bow that reduced \nwater-surface \ncontact \narea, \nwhich \nimproved \nmaneuverability and reduced turning time.  A 20\u00b0 \nentry angle and 4 in. rocker at the bow was \nmaintained in this year\u2019s design. The use of a \nrounded stern improves the canoe\u2019s steering and \nmaneuverability. The introduction of a keel at the \nstern improved tracking during straightaways.   \nThe team designed a flat bottom as part of the \nwetted surface area to increase stability and lower \ntipping motion. The proposed flat bottom section of \n12 in. at the maximum beam width tapered down to \n4 ft.  \u2013 11.5 in. bow-wise and 4 ft. \u2013 5.5 in. stern-wise. \nAfter adding all the structural elements, TANAM\u00c1\u2019s \nfinal dimensions are 20 ft. 9 in. in length, and 30.875 \nin. of maximum beam width located 9 in. from the \ncenter bow-wise.   \nUsing Rhino 5\u00ae, the final 3D model of the \ncanoe was created. The Orca 3D\u00ae plug-in for Rhino \nwas used to divide the canoe into 4 in. sections and \nto obtain various coefficients for the canoe\u2019s length. \nDuring the preliminary stage of the design, \nconservative values for the canoe\u2019s and paddlers\u2019 \nweights were used, resulting in conservative \ncoefficient values. Actual weight values were later \nmodeled. A comparison of assumed weight versus \nactual weight values are presented in Table 4.  \nThe prismatic coefficient (CP) provides an \nindication of how narrow the ends are relative to the \nmidsection of the hull. A low prismatic coefficient \nmeans that there are narrow ends and a wide mid-\nbody which reduces drag. For any given speed-to-\nlength ratio, there is a corresponding optimum value \nfor the prismatic coefficient. (Sailboat-Cruising.com \n2016)  \n TANAM\u00c1\u2019s hull speed was obtained using \nEquation 1, which is calculated using the waterline \nlength (LWL) given by Orca 3D\u00ae for all conditions.  \n\u072a\u0735= 1.34\u221a\u072e\u0739\u072e \n \n(1) \nThe optimum hull speed was estimated at \n5.95 knots (10.04 ft. /s) for a 1.34 speed/length ratio, \nas seen above.

With a rich \nhistory of success, WKU Concrete Canoe Team has placed in the \ntop 5 nationally four times, with the most recent 5th place finish \nat the last in-person competition in 2019. That year our student \nchapter was a Ridgeway Award Finalist before reaching the \npinnacle in 2020 by becoming \nRobert \nRidgeway \nAward \nWinner.  More recently, WKU \nwas awarded a Certificate of \nCommendation \n(top \n5% \nof \nstudent chapters) in 2021 and \n2022, rounding out the four most successful years ever for the student chapter. \nThis year, WKU ASCE continues the successful run with the progress made \nin 2021, with 91 students registered as national ASCE members, including \napproximately 55% of our Junior and Senior students.  Last year was difficult, \nbut in those hard times WKU ASCE \nprospered by hosting guest speakers, \nfield trips, and social events through \nin-person and virtual events.  \nWKU ASCE has a tradition \nof giving back to our community.  On December 11, 2021, a powerful \nEF-3 tornado ripped through Bowling Green, Kentucky, narrowly \navoiding WKU\u2019s campus.  The next day, despite the start of winter \nbreak, over 20 students gathered to clean up trees and debris around \nour community (Figure 2).  Over the next few weeks, more than 60 \nWKU ASCE students and alumni teamed up with several local \nengineering firms to assist in cleanup.  In addition to disaster relief, \nchapter members were able to participate in many other community service events, including layout of the \ninternational festival (Figure 3), and students were able to decorate and fill Christmas stockings for the less \nfortunate youth of our community (Figure 4).   \nIn a year with ever changing guidelines at the national level, WKU has been consistent, allowing \nstudents to participate safely in several face-to-face activities.  For many students, this was their first \nopportunity to truly become active members. This year\u2019s highlight was a field \ntrip to Stupp Bridge Company for STEELDAY 2021, where students saw the \nprocess of fabricating bridge parts (Figure 5). Additionally, the members \npresent attended several presentations for local engineering firms and learned \nmore about career opportunities after graduation.  WKU ASCE also co-hosted \nan event with the National Society of Black Engineers and Habitat for Humanity \nwhere students tie-dyed T-shirts. On average, nearly 40 students attended WKU \nASCE\u2019s ten most attended events.  While attendance was slightly lower than \n2020, there were still many great opportunities for students to network with \neach other and potential employers. \nThe WKU ASCE Student Chapter\u2019s mission statement is to bring all \ncivil engineering students together and to supplement academics with \nfriendships, professional"}

Therefore, the StalacTOP canoe form was not modified, which saved \n$1800 by avoiding a form replacement, as well as limiting environmental impact. \nThe 2019 StalacTOP had a length of 240 in., a depth of 15 in., \na maximum width of 27.0 in., with a 0.5 in. average thickness, a 5.0 \nin. stern rocker, and a 4.3 in. bow rocker. Mon Row retained the same \nhull shape but differed with a depth of 16 in. due to the increased \ncanoe weight, and had a maximum width of 27.5 in. The rocker \nremained consistent due to its maneuverability in the slalom race and \nthe soft chine remained constant from StalacTOP due to its aesthetic \nappeal. \nSince the canoe mix\u2019s unit weight was higher than 62.4 pcf, \nbulkheads were necessary to achieve resurfacing during the flotation \ntest. To size the bulkheads, the practice canoe was taken to the lake \nalong with polystyrene foam boards. Foam board pieces were \nincrementally added to the stern and bow until buoyancy was \nachieved and the canoe was balanced front to back. On each side four inches of additional board was added to \ncounteract the concrete encapsulating the bulkheads. This ensured paddler safety and the environmental \nresponsibility of keeping the canoe from sinking in the event of a catastrophic failure. \nFor the layering scheme and reinforcing layers of the canoe, the team considered both a three-layer and \ntwo-layer canoe. Ultimately, the team decided that the benefits in strength of a three-layer canoe were \nbeneficial enough to justify the increased \nweight. For reinforcement, a layer of \nEIFS fiberglass mesh was placed \nbetween each layer because of its \nlightweight nature, flexural strength and \npunching shear prevention (Table 5). For \nadditional reinforcement, seven total \nlongitudinal cables (three on each side \nand one along the keel) were placed \nbetween the first and second layers to \nimprove composite flexural strength.  \nTable 3: Drag Force in Racing Scenarios \nHull \nCategory \nRace \nDesired \nSpeed (ft/s) \nTotal \nDrag (lb) \nStalacTOP \nMen \nSprint \n10.5 \n11.3 \nSlalom \n7.7 \n6.3 \nWomen \nSprint \n9.2 \n8.2 \nSlalom \n6.7 \n4.7 \n4-Person \nSprint \n8.9 \n9.9 \nProposed \nDesign \nMen \nSprint \n10.5 \n12.4 \nSlalom \n7.7 \n6.4 \nWomen \nSprint \n9.2 \n9.1 \nSlalom \n6.7 \n5.1 \n4-Person \nSprint \n8.9 \n10.3 \nTable 4: Flume Test \nHull \nIncline \nTime (s) \nAvg.

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant that writes proposals for the ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "prompt": "Write the development and testing section for an ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "output": ". To calculate shear and bending moments for racing \nscenarios, the canoe was considered to be right side up and \nanalyzed as a simply supported reinforced concrete beam with \nzero force reactions. A distributed load of 16 lb/ft was applied \non top of the beam to represent the canoe weight, and a \ndistributed load ranging from 30-50 lb/ft on the bottom \ndepending on the racing scenario to represent the buoyant \nforce, with the paddlers represented as point loads. \nTo find the design criteria, the above information was \nentered into an Excel\u2122 spreadsheet to determine the \nmaximum shear, moment, and stresses in each load case \n(Figure 6). The beam\u2019s ultimate shear force was calculated to \nbe 160 lbs and the beam\u2019s ultimate moment was calculated to \nbe 800 ft-lb (Appendix C), both of which were in the simply \nsupported condition. The simply supported right-side-up load \ncase had the highest compressive strength with 190 psi, while \nthe highest composite flexural strength was on the simply \nsupported upside-down load case at 190 psi. These values \nwere then delivered to the mix design team to be used as the \nminimum design constraints. Primary and secondary \nreinforcements were included within the concrete for \ncomposite flexural strength.  \nThe freeboard and draught calculations (Table 6) were \ndone by calculating the submerged volume of the canoe at \nvarious depths of submersion. The four-person co-ed had the \nlowest freeboard with 5.7 in. Even with the given load \nscenario of \u201cself-weight of canoe + 1000 lb.\u201d, there was a \nfreeboard of 3.5 in., meaning there is a large factor of safety \nin this scenario, even for tilting and wave factors. These \nvalues were used when the team was considering the depth of \nthe canoe so that the waterline would never be higher than the \ngunwale. \nLoad cases under all relevant parameters include: two \nmale paddlers, two female paddlers, four co-ed paddlers, and \nsimply supported right side up/upside down (Table 7).

This \nmaximized \nthe \ncomposite \nflexural \nstrength and ensured the strongest cross \nsection possible. The exterior layers were \nboth designed to be 0.095 in. each, while \nthe middle layer was 0.180 in. For \nreinforcement, there was a mesh layer \nplaced between each layer of concrete. \nThree braided steel cables were placed on \neach side of the canoe to reinforce the \nmoment \nalong \nthe \ngunwale. \nA \nlongitudinal steel cable was placed down \nthe center of the hull and traverse cables \nwere placed at paddler knees \nto \ncounteract punching shear. \nWhile the final canoe was chosen \nto be three layers, there were many \ndiscussions about the possibility of \nmaking a two-layer canoe. While this \ncanoe would have had a much lighter \nweight compared to the final canoe, it \nwould also result in a much thinner and weaker prototype. Based off experimental results from past canoes, it \nwas found that creating a two-layer canoe could lead to delamination. To avoid these potential issues, the team \nsimply continued with the original plan of a three-layer canoe. \nFor primary reinforcement of the canoe, 1/16 in. steel cable and fiberglass mesh were selected due to \naccessibility and cost effectiveness. For secondary reinforcement, \nNycon\u00ae-PVA RECS15 fibers were selected (Table 9). This was \nselected over other alternatives such as Hemp fibers to reduce the \namount of processing time.

The form \nconsists of a MDF Board backbone and ribbed cross-sections with foam \ninsulation board between each rib. The form is split into five sections, which are \npieced together with dowel rods.  These modular sections allow simple \ndisassembly, storage, and reassembly. This method avoids replacing a $1,800 \nform, allows cost effective modification of individual sections, and enhances \nenvironmental sustainability. While wet curing in 2020, the form was damaged \nfrom water contact. To begin repair, the form was assembled, and loose pieces \nwere removed.

To ensure structural integrity, the EIFS Fiberglass Mesh was sewn \ntogether on both ends of the canoe (Figure 13).

The first mesh layer was \naccompanied by 3 Blue Hawk\u2122 Weld-less Steel Cables placed longitudinally \non each side: two near the gunwale and one near the chine. An additional cable \nwas placed down the center of the canoe; each cable was pretensioned to 85 lbs. \nDepth gauges of nylon trimmer line (0.095\u201d) were used for the first and third \nlayers, while nylon trimmer line encased inside vinyl tubing (0.180\u201d) was used \nfor the second layer. This method reduced compression of the hollow vinyl \ntubing, which could cause an uneven depth. The depth gauges were placed on \nthe form every 6 inches, to guide the trowels when placing concrete. Each depth \ngauge layer was offset from the previous layer by 3 inches to prevent weak \nlocations in the canoe. To reinforce paddler locations, two transverse steel \ncables were added under each location of the paddler\u2019s knees. Before the pour, \n6-inch slots for depth gauges were cut into the gunwale strips. The gunwale \nstrips controlled the canoe depth and assisted in placing concrete on the form at the pre-calculated width.  \nDuring the first pour several issues arose. The lower workability of the initial mix caused the first and \nthird layers to be spread thicker than the depth gauge. Inconsistent depth gauge spacing contributed to this \nissue, as it made it hard to accurately place the concrete between them. Another issue was the mesh not being \nprecut to the form shape, which increased"}

The mix team \nworked two additional months to create a more workable mix for \nthe final pour that made it easier to apply a thinner layer on the \nform. The improved mix drastically aided time management, \nreducing the final pour from 15 to 13 hours. After the initial set, \ntowels were placed on the canoe and kept damp for 14 days (Figure \n14). For canoe demolding, gunwale strips were removed, cables \nwere cut, and the shrink wrap was cut at the base of the form, \nfollowed by the whole team lifting the canoe at once. After \nremoval, the focus turned to sanding. 200 to 1,000 grit sanders were \nused to smooth any imperfections. Low spots were patched with a \nhighly workable grout mix. Once the grout had been applied, it was \ngiven 24 hours to set up. The grout was then sanded until the canoe had a smooth outer layer, and this process \nwas repeated until the entire outside of the canoe was deemed \nsmooth. When the whole outside of the canoe was grouted and \nsmoothed, the structural mix was used to encase the bulkheads. \nAutoCAD\u00ae was used to design adhesive stencils for canoe inlays, \nwhich were placed on the canoe. Dremel\u00ae tools were used to cut \nout the school name, canoe name, and aesthetic inlays to \nincorporate the bluegrass theme (Figure 15). Pigmented structural \nconcrete was dyed with Direct\u2122 Colors concrete pigment and was \nplaced back into the voids. The inlays were and sanded to remove \nimperfections and ensure smoothness with the outside face of the \ncanoe. \nTo polish, the canoe was wet sanded from 400 to 10,000 \ngrit to achieve a smooth finish after the inlays and bulkheads were \ninstalled (Figure 16). The team began by wet sanding the outside \nof the canoe and the bulkheads, and then wet sanded the inside. \nOnce the process was complete two coats of EAGLE Premium \nCoat sealer were applied to the canoe for a gloss finish. \nFigure 14: Curing the Canoe"}

After having the budget gradually decrease \nover the years, WKU concrete canoe has developed proactive measures to benefit the current year, while also \nsetting up future teams for success. Having a multifaceted approach to social, economic and environmental \nsustainability enhances participation with local and global community benefits.  \nSocial sustainability is imperative to current and future teams. \nDue to COVID-19, participation has decreased in student projects and \nstudent chapters. To build back our community, concrete canoe and our \nASCE chapter became interwoven; events such as pour day were \npromoted at ASCE meetings and members were invited to participate. \nASCE benefited as well, transforming pour day into a social event \nincluding potluck style food and music. As a result, both groups \nbenefitted in the short term with more participation and in the long term \nwith transfer of knowledge and cultivating a family atmosphere. Due to \nthe lack of experience in the canoe project because of COVID-19, it was \nimperative to pass down as much information as possible to future teams. \nAll parts of the canoe project were new for this team; only four people \nfrom the current team attended a concrete canoe pour in the past. To \nensure the transfer of knowledge that the current team lacked, a Project \nExecution File was used to share information, not only between team \nmembers, but to future teams as well. In the Project Execution File, \ndifficult aspects of the project were emphasized, and advice was given to \nprevent setbacks. Through our adversity, this transfer of knowledge will \nhopefully make the completion of the project less challenging and more \nstreamlined for future teams. \nEconomic sustainability was essential to deliver a high-quality product and to set up future teams for \nsuccess. Over the years, the concrete canoe budget declined from approximately $4,500 in 2015 to $2,040 in \n2022. To succeed with a small budget, the team was creative with products, methods, and purchasing habits. \nStalacTOP\u2019s modular form was reused this year, which saved $1,800, and will be available for future teams.  \nWhen creating test mixes, batch size was reduced by 50% in volume to save materials (Figure 17). When \nacquiring materials, donations were sought first and then needed materials were purchased in bulk. Bulk \npurchasing was done whenever possible to keep unit costs low and restock materials for future teams. \nThe largest part of environmental sustainability was retaining the male form. To replace the form, six \nsheets of MDF board, six sheets of foam board, plywood, and other materials are required. It additionally took \n50 hours to assemble when it was originally fabricated in \n2019. To make the form last for many years, the form was \ndesigned in five modular sections (Figure 18), allowing \nmodifications to each section rather than the entire form. \nBy doing this, the team is can repair the form from year \nto year rather than replacing it, even if multiple sections \nwere damaged or need redesign. This not only cuts down \nthe cost but allows the team to make cost effective \nmodifications to stay competitive in the races. Additional \nenvironmental benefit came from using the power 0.45 \ncurve to create a tight-fitting aggregate matrix to reduce \nbinder usage, which reduces the environmental impact of \nportland cement manufacturing. When creating the \nstands and display for the project, the team reused as \nmany materials as possible. \nSustainability \nFigure 18: The Modular Form \nFigure 17: Creating a Test Mix \n \n13 | P a g e  \nThe project began by selecting a team captain to oversee the project\u2019s quality control and quality \nassurance (QA/QC).

Four load cases (left) were evaluated for longitudinal \nbending and general shear \u2013 simply-supported, calm water, and \nlong waves with crest at midship and crests at the ends \u2013 based \non prescribed paddler positions and loads.

Likewise, as the wave crest is \nshifted to the ends and troughs are at midpoint, similar \ndecreases in shear and moment ooccur. As these are taken at instantaneous points in time, these changes are \ndeemed to be conservative, however, our designers opine that they should be taken into consideration and \nwarrant further and more comprehensive evaluation. \nTraverse stresses caused by waves and wind acting on the \nsidewalls can result in racking (distortion)[10]. Due to low exposed \nprofiles, wind loads are considered negligible. A maximum \ndisplacement scenario (left) models the sidewalls as cantilevered \nbeams with linearly distributed hydrostatic pressure and a bouyant \nforce acting uniformly across the bilge. Under this condition, a net \nmoment of 25 ft-lb occurs at the transition between the chines and \nsidewalls with a maximum shear stress of approximately 100 lb/in2 \noccurring laterally along the chine and upwards along the bilge. \nTorsional moments result from unsymmetrical quasi-static loading, such as paddlers shifting their weight, \nand hydrodynamic wave-induced loading coupled with hull roll, pitch, and yaw[10]. Torsional moments and \nstresses in a canoe are typically negligible since they are small in comparison to those from longitudinal \nbending; however, our designers sought to quantify these values. For simplicity, the four-person co-ed (worst-\ncase scenario) considers bow and stern paddlers shifting their respective weights to opposite sides of the hull \ninducing a net torque of 170 ft-lb (accounting for buoyancy reaction). Torsional shearing stresses (fs) are found \nby considering the hull as a noncircular beam with a thin open section[1]. Based on an estimated shear modulus \n(G) of 300 kips/in2, a maximum shearing stress (fs,max) of 220 lb/in2 occurs near midship. The shifting of paddler \nweight, when stabilizing the canoe or making sharp turns, also results in localized punching shear. The \nunfactored punching stress caused by a 200 lbs paddler shifting their entire weight onto one knee, with an \neffective area of 4-in x 4-in, is 16 lb/in2, while the punching shear stress capacity (vn)[3] of the proposed \u00be-in. \nthick hull section is 128 lb/in2.  \nThe"}

Following the \u201csimple and rationale\u201d methodology for conventional \nSCC([34], aggregate content is fixed, and adjustments are made to water, binders, and admixture dosage until \nspecified fresh and hardened properties are met[39]. Our designers formulated a lightweight, moderate strength \nECC based on familiarity with materials, research, and consultation with industry experts and team alumni. \nAggregates \u2013 Per the RFP[4], aggregates must meet certain volumetric percentages of lightweight aggregate \n(ASTM C330) and/or recycled concrete aggregate (RCA), and their gradation meeting the definition of \u201cfine \naggregate\u201d (ASTM C125). Pulverizing concrete, which requires the use of jaw and impact crushers, still results \nin particle sizes usually greater than the No. 4 sieve[38], therefore RCA was deemed impractical. Our proposed \nC330 aggregate is Norlite\u2122 expanded shale (No. 4 to No. 200) which our teams have used since 2010.  \nWhen used alone, the expanded shale results in concrete densities \nof 100 lb/ft3 or more. To compensate, lightweight alternatives \u2013 foamed \nglass aggregate (AeroAggregate\u00ae), cork, epoxy-coated foam granules \n(CityMix\u00ae), and polymeric spheres (Elemix\u00ae) \u2013 were considered. The \nfoamed glass aggregate, processed just outside of Philadelphia, has \nphysical properties similar to other ASTM C330 materials and did not \nresult in a reduction in density. The remaining three are similar in terms \nof their low specific gravities and low absorption properties. The \neventual selection of Elemix\u00ae Type XE was based on our familiarity \nwith the product and success in its use in previous mixtures.  \nBinders \u2013 A majority of past Drexel designs have been formulations of ternary binders comprised primarily of \neither Type I or Type III portland cement (ASTM C150) and supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) such \nas slag, fly ash, metakaolin or microsilica. These resulted in a lightweight, yet dense paste, with a high plastic \nviscosity and low permeability that is resistant to segregation and bleeding[24-27,30,35]. Designs strengths would \nbe achieved within 7 to 14 days after casting, at which time the canoe could be demolded and finished.  This has \nled our designers to consider options to speed up this process and the proposed use of CSA cement (ASTM \nC1600), a hydraulic binder that can be used with ordinary portland cement (OPC) to quickly develop strength, \nshorten set times, add durability, and decrease the shrinkage of standard concrete mixture designs.  \nOur review of product literature[7] and discussions with representatives of Buzzi Unicem USA[8] indicated \nthat set times can vary from 15 minutes (100% CSA, in weight) to 160 minutes (20% CSA/80% OPC), with \ndesign strengths attained in 24 hours or less, potentially within 4 to 8 hours of casting. For our project, it was \nrecommended that a minimum CSA/OPC ratio of 60/40 be used.  During verification"}

Our proposed dosages of Sika\u00ae \nViscoCrete\u00ae 2100 (HRWR) and Stabilizer-4R (VMA) are based on those used in past designs. \nFibers \u2013 Increased ductility and flexural strengths result from the use of \nshort discontinuous steel or synthetic fibers. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) \nfibers were selected due to their crack-fighting properties, modulus of \nelasticity, excellent tensile and molecular bond strength.

At this point in time, Drexel has not made a decision regarding classroom instruction for the \nWinter term (January to March 2021). Our best guess is that we will either continue to stay remote through \nthe winter months or possibly change to a hybrid instruction. We do not anticipate that full time, in \nclassroom instruction will take place this academic year. We currently do not have access to our lab spaces \nand we do not foresee that we will be able to have access next term. \n \n \nIn 250 words or less, provide a high-level overview of the team\u2019s Health & Safety (H&S) Program.

Include \na discussion on the impact of COVID-19 on the team\u2019s ability to perform work and what plans would be \nimplemented assuming work could be performed. \n \nDrexel University maintains a health and safety program for all of its lab spaces on campus. Within this \nprogram are online training modules that students must complete to gain access to the lab space. Drexel\u2019s \nConcrete Canoe Lab has its own more specific Health and Safety (H&S) program. This plan includes \nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for possible hazardous activities in the lab. Each student who enters \nthe lab and plans on partaking in these activities must review and sign all SOPs. Chemical inventories are \ntaken every year and any unused substances that are expired are properly disposed of. PPE such as face \nshields, gloves, aprons, safety glasses, etc. are restocked and examined to ensure they are in safe working \ncondition.  \n \nThe Drexel University policies on COVID-19 will be adhered too as well as any local, state or national \nguidelines.

To compensate for this, the \nteam designed a canoe catered for the inexperienced \npaddler. This manifested itself in its hull shape, which \nprioritized stability. Furthermore, previous rowers \ncomplained that a V-shaped hull was difficult to sit in, \nresulting in the use of a hybrid hull shape, rectifying \nthis issue. \nJet\u2019s mix hardened at an especially slow rate, \nleading to poor early strength and difficulty of use. To \nsolve this problem, Rise\u2019s mix featured the addition of \nMasterSet accelerator, dramatically reducing the \nhardening time and increasing viability. \nPrevious NYU Tandon Concrete Canoe teams \napplied concrete directly to the mold of the canoe. This \ntechnique occasionally resulted in inconsistent \nthickness and weak points in the canoe. This year, the \nteam rolled out slabs on a thickness gauge before \napplying the slabs onto the mold, resulting in \nconsistent thickness throughout the entirety of the \ncanoe. \nRelative to previous NYU Tandon Canoe, the \nembossing on Rise is much thicker. This allows for \ngreater pronunciation and visibility, capturing the \nviewer\u2019s eye.  \n \nManufacturing Cost Estimate \n \nBased on careful tracking of expenses, the team \nestimated that a single canoe would cost $23,136. This \nestimate is based on a combination of labor costs for \nmold and canoe fabrication and material costs for each \nprocess. \nDuring both the mold fabrication process, \ncaptains \nrequired \nthat \nindividual \nmembers \nmeticulously recorded   their labor hours in personal \nnotebooks. These numbers were then reported to the \ncaptains to assess the costs of their labor. This was \ncalculated based on their job title, with more skilled \nmembers being paid higher wages, and the number of \nhours they worked. Based on this, the team found mold \nfabrication to cost $18,609. However, in practice a \nsingle mold can be used to make three canoes before \nreplacement is necessary, Subsequently, in production, \nthe cost of the mold per canoe would be $6,203. \nTo track the cost of mold fabrication, members \ninputting orders first tracked the unit cost of the \nmaterial ordered. During the mold\u2019s creation, members \nbuilding it tracked the amount of material they used. \nSumming the unit costs multiplied by the amount used \nfor each material, the team found that mold fabrication \nwould cost a total of $3,077. \nThe canoe fabrication process was also \ncalculated in a similar manner to that of the mold \nfabrication process. Individuals tracked and reported \ntheir own hours. Using these reported hours and the \ngiven job title of each member, the cost of fabrication \nper canoe was calculated to be $12,125. \nCanoe material costs were meticulously \ntracked by members responsible for ordering the \nnecessary materials in bulk. They then recorded how \nmuch each unit costs, along with the manufacture. \nDuring the actual fabrication process, team members \ntracked the amount materials being used. Using this \ninformation along with the unit price of the materials, \nthe material cost for a single canoe was assessed to be \n$767. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProduction Proposal \n \n \n17 \nNew York University Tandon 2024 \nRise \nRise \nManufacturing Cost Estimate \u2013 Fee Schedule \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPermanent Material Costs - Per Canoe \nMaterial \nQTY \nUnit \nCost/Unit \nCost \nSource \nSlag \n114.00 \n lb  \n $         0.02  \n$   2.28  \nRock Utah \nGypsum \n20.00 \n lb  \n $         0.02  \n$   0.40  \nUS Geological Survey \nPoraver 0.1-0.4 mm \n20.00 \n lb  \n $         1.02  \n$   20.40  \nConcreteTexturingTool&Supply \nS38 \n13.00 \n lb  \n $       19.00  \n$   247.00  \nTheEpoxyExperts \nTrinic SP (HRWR) \n0.13 \n lb  \n $       12.99  \n$   1.69  \nTrinic US \nMasterSet FP20 \n5.00 \n lb  \n $         2.57  \n$   12.85  \nExample Supplier \nPVA fibers \n54.00 \n lb  \n $         8.94  \n$   482.76  \nContractor Source \nPermanent Material Costs per Canoe (MC) \n$   767.38  \n  \nCanoe Fabrication Labor Costs - Per Canoe \nRole \nRLR \nDEC \nHRS \nExtended \nPrincipal Design Engineer  \n$   50.00  \n1.5 \n17 \n$   1,275.00  \nDesign Manager  \n$   45.00  \n1.5 \n17 \n$   1,147.50  \nProject"}

The length of \nthe canoe was reduced by 0.4 ft for ease of turning and the height was \nincreased by 0.5 in for more clearance from the water line (Table 2). In \naddition, more capacity was considered for Blue Fin, allowing it to \nquickly reach fullness to provide more stability. The cross section of \nSpotlight (2018) and Blue Fin are shown in Figure 1. While Spotlight \nhas a rounder bottom for greater secondary stability, Blue Fin \nwas designed using a shallow arch profile to balance between \na flat and a round hull. Due to the wide selection of shallow \narches, the team used DELFTship to develop three hulls with \nvarying cross sections to optimize the balance between \ntracking and maneuverability.  \nVarious design parameters were \nconsidered to analyze the performance of \nBlue Fin under co-ed racing condition. \nThe initial stability is closely associated with the transverse metacentric height of the hull. \nThe design focused on a higher transverse metacentric height and a reduced waterline height. \nKoi (2016) exhibits a design with high initial stability, but low secondary stability, thus its \ntransverse metacentric height of 1.068 ft was used as the upper limit for Blue Fin. The team \ncompared design parameter outputs for the three hull profiles and chose the one with the most \ndesirable data. Table 3 summarizes the resulting parameters from DELFTship. An increased \nbeam level at the waterline is observed, suggesting higher initial stability and less rolling \nmotion on the canoe. To ensure that straight line tracking and \npaddling efficiency is not compromised in this design, the speed-\nlength-ratio (SLR) was calculated using an estimated paddling speed; \nan average of 3 knots and maximum of 6 knots were considered. The \nSLR allowed the team to obtain a prismatic coefficient (Cp), where \nBlue Fin has a slightly lower value than Spotlight. This indicates that \nthe final design has a narrower end, which is beneficial for high speed \ntravels. To accurately verify and compare the drag force on the hull, \na scale model was 3D printed and tested in a water channel (Figure \n2). While the model is static, the water ran through the channel and a \nforce sensor collected the magnitude of the drag.

The pigment contents \nwere tested with an iterative trial to obtain the intensity of the design color, with consideration of the manufacturer \nrecommendations and the material\u2019s strength. For example, the team\u2019s blue pigments were recommended at 8% \nor less.  \nThe primary reinforcements selected were glass fiber mesh and galvanized steel wire rope. The team \nfocused on choosing a mesh that is more flexible than the previous year's. Carbon fiber mesh was first considered \nfor primary reinforcement because of its strength and workability. However, difficulty with procurement \nprevented the team from using the product. As an alternative, the team used glass fiber mesh that was relatively \nmore flexible to properly cover all reinforcement areas. The galvanized steel rope was designed to be embedded \nin the gunwale for proper reinforcement. This year, the layering scheme features two layers of mesh embedded \nin three layers of concrete. In Spotlight\u2019s (2018) year, only a single layer of mesh was used. Although a simplified \nlayering scheme resulted in a lightweight canoe, the strength and quality may have been compromised. In addition, \nthe incorporation of shotcrete is expected to shorten casting time, therefore placing multiple layers is unlikely to \nresult in delamination problems.

The amount of fibers was strictly controlled while performing workability tests, as fibers \nnegatively impact the flow. Furthermore, an overdose of fiber content can result in malfunctioning of the shotcrete \nnozzle, as the opening may be prone to congestion.

Utilizing the heat of hydration, the samples were thermally cured to reach a higher \nearly strength. The team sustainably used the Styrofoam insulation from the previous year to save on budget and \nschedule. \nThe samples were tested for their compressive, flexural, and tensile strengths. The compressive test was \nconducted on 2 in by 4 in cylinders, per modified ASTM C39. A direct tensile test was performed with modified \nASTM D3039 and flexural test conducted per modified ASTM D7264. The results are shown on Table 6.

The team researched methods of creating detailed, \nthree dimensional designs to add to the aesthetic of the canoe design. Using the \nschool\u2019s Makerspace, various designs were printed using a 3D printer. These \ndesigns were then made into rubber molds for concrete casting. The nature of \nthis technique was able to capture the fine mark and details on any design, \nwhether 3D printed or in real life. When the rubber mold was ready, concrete \nmix was poured in, allowing for intricate concrete designs used on the final \ncanoe product (Figure 9). The 2D cork stencil designs, on the other hand, were \ncut out by the laser cutter (Figure 10). The team used digital design for these \ntechniques to be most efficient in production. \nA female mold was selected for smooth finishes on the outer surface, \nas well as for insulation in the curing stage. Expanded polystyrene (EPS) was \nselected as the mold material, due to its cost effectiveness. The EPS mold is \nalso used by the team in transporting the canoe for long distances, thus serving \nmultiple purposes. Mold preparation began with the delivery of three cross \nsections fabricated by manufacturers. This year, an unexpected shipment \ndamage occurred on the sections, which required repair work. Spray adhesives were applied on damaged pieces \nto reconstruct the mold. After aligning the sections, plywood bracings were \nplaced at the joints to secure the mold. Longitudinal reinforcement bracing was \nprovided by straps that tightly surrounded the entire mold. The damaged epoxy \ncoating was repaired by applying an adhesive putty at cracked spots and joints. \nThe entirety of the mold interior was sanded to ensure a smooth finish. \nTo create detailed designs on the canoe surface, the team used laser cut \nstencil designs of sea life and placed them all along the interior of the canoe. \nFor efficiency, multiple designs were placed on the same stencil sheet in order \nto reduce the amount of stencil waste. The team was able to place up to 6 \ndesigns per stencil sheet, greatly reducing costs and overall waste. Designs \nincluded coral structures, fish, and other aquatic animals. The school name \nletters were also laser cut and placed on the exterior of the canoe at one inch \ndown from the gunwale. After the stencils were placed, mold release was \nsprayed to ensure ease of demolding once curing is finished. During casting, \n1/8 inch rubber strips were placed along the entire canoe to ensure accurate concrete layer thickness (Figure 11). \nFigure 10: Laser-cutting cork \nstencils \nFigure 11: Rubber strips for \nthickness control \nFigure 9: 3D concrete design"}

The mixture was prepared using a hand-\nheld high shear mixer. The mix design team pre-batched constituents to control the quality. As the team was \nlaying the mix, captains went around to spray water on the concrete to maintain moisture and prevent cold bonding. \nAt the same time, QA/QC officers inspected the activity site to make sure the layer thickness was correctly \ncontrolled with rubber strips. The strips were removed after placement and the resulting cavities were carefully \nfilled in and leveled with other surfaces. After the first layer was hand-applied, a glass fiber mesh was placed onto \nthe face mix and patted in. The team then used a shotcrete gun to apply the backing mix for the second layer of \nconcrete (Figure 12). The shotcrete gun was incredibly efficient, \nallowing the backing mix to be applied in a greatly reduced time. After \nthe second layer of mix was sprayed with shotcrete, another layer of \nmesh was placed. The layering finished with the final placement of a 1/8 \ninch thick layer, bringing the total thickness to 3/8 inch. The gunwale \nwas thickened to \u00bd inch with 3/32 inch galvanized steel wire embedded \nfor reinforcement. A gunwale mold was used to ensure uniform \nthickness along the length of the canoe. With the application of the new \nshotcrete method, overall casting time was reduced by 2 hours along with \n50% reduction in crew size. \nAfter casting was completed, a wet curing chamber was \nconstructed by submerging the canoe with water and covering with bags. \nThe mold provides insulation and the submerged canoe will have enough \nmoisture during curing. The canoe was left to cure for two weeks, then \ndewatered and demolded. For mold removal, the team carefully removed \nboth the canoe and gunwale molds. The materials will be reused for the \nsupport stands as well as the display stand, promoting sustainability with \nreduced waste. A pneumatic polisher was used to wet sand the canoe \ninterior (Figure 13).

The last focal point was the transformational involvement of industry professionals which allowed for \ndeeper mentoring opportunities for the team. \nInnovation was a major goal and focus for this year. UT Tyler has decided to cast Camoo with a female \nstyle mold, even though a male mold has traditionally been used. However, with curiosity peaked from previous \nSymposia attendance, the captains this year decided to take on the challenge. One of the main deciding factors \nfor the use of a female mold was that the mold switch should allow for less time spent sanding the exterior of the \ncanoe. To accomplish this female mold, the team used CNC fabrication to cut the mold as cross-sectional slices. \nThis allows for greater precision in dimensional cuts which decreases the amount of time spent sanding \nimperfections. This mold style also assists in the ease of demolding and the reduction of shrinkage cracking due \nto the concrete shrinking in and thus away from the mold. Additionally, the team used precast depth gauges to \nmeasure each layer of the canoe on pour day. This was a learning experience for the whole team as UT Tyler has \nnot utilized this technique in a long time. This method ensures accuracy throughout the canoe as each depth gauge \nwas cast to specific measurements prior to pour day.   \n \n2\nMore than 50 mixes were created this year over the course of 7 months.

This canoe length has been utilized by UT \nTyler since 2018 with a goal to maintain tracking capability with a longer canoe hull. While increasing length \ndoes reduce turning capability, most of the races feature longer straight-sprint sections, so tracking was crucial. \nThe team then focused  more on turning technique in practice to make up for longer length. In the last few years, \nUT Tyler has chosen to sacrifice speed and maneuverability in favor of stability and durability. This year, the \nteam chose to revert to a different design focus used by past canoe teams.  In 2014, Daisy Bradford #3 (2014) \nhighlighted a narrow hull with a maximum width of 27\u201d and a cut off stern. \nWhile Daisy did not win her regional competition, she performed incredibly \nwell in the paddling category. This design of a cut off stern propelled the \nteam into reimagining how this year\u2019s canoe would be designed. The goal of \nthe flat stern is to reduce the force and effort required by a paddler to turn the \ncanoe. By reducing the length of the canoe behind the pivot point in a turn, \nor the paddler at the back, we were able to use less force because less water \nis being shoved out of the way. Therefore, by \ncutting off the stern, the effort required to turn Camoo is reduced. In addition, \nreferencing Excaliboat (2017), the team saw that having a soft chine and high rocker \nimproved turning due to a reduced turning radius, however, the design led to instability \nand reduced the ability to go straight.  \nWhen deciding on the"}

To \nensure that the course lengths were kept consistent even though \nthey were performed on different days, a golf rangefinder was implemented during buoy placement to control \ncourse length. As seen in Table 3, cutting off the stern made an improvement in the racing times. \nIn addition to comparing different stern shapes, bow shape was considered as well.

The \nfollowing load cases were considered: paddling (two-\nman, two-woman, four-person coed with the women \npositioned on the ends, four-person coed with the men \npositioned on the ends), display, and transportation. For \nthe paddling load case calculations, men were assumed \nto be point loads of 250 lbs and women point loads of \n180 lbs, with the buoyant force as point loads at 2\u201d \nstations along the canoe. This was computed using Archimedes\u2019 principle by finding the volume of the boat \nsubmerged in the water. The display loading case was calculated assuming two stands 4 ft from Camoo\u2019s ends \nwith only self-weight considered. With our canoe being transported using a wheeled cart, support every two feet \nwith nylon straps, the self-weight was doubled to account for dynamic impact.  Moments were then computed \nthrough double integration method. Two different coed cases were analyzed, and it was found that the intended \npaddler positioning, with women at the bow and stern and \nmen in the middle, caused a smaller moment than \npreviously reported in coed load cases. This was due to \nthe decision to have a female rudder in the coed race, \nleading to a significant change in the resulting moment. \nHaving the heavier men in the middle of the canoe \nprovided the benefit of reducing the maximum resulting \nmoment. As seen in Figure 6, comparing the moment \ndiagrams of all 6 cases, the two-man load case controls, \nwith a maximum moment of 5552 lb-in located 8.5\u2019 from \nthe bow. As such, this case was then used to compute the \noverall factor of safety moving forward. \nNext, punching shear was analyzed. It was determined that the maximum stress occurs at the paddler\u2019s \nkneecap, therefore punching shear was analyzed for a 3\u201d diameter circle going into the bottom of the hull with all \nthe paddler\u2019s weight bearing into one knee.

Phase 1 began with practice cylinders to \nensure that the QA/QC officer and mix captain understood the fundamentals of creating and casting concrete. \nPhase II entailed the variation of Poraver to cement, i.e., the ratio of the volumes of aggregate to paste in the mix. \nThis phase also included variations in the amount of water being used, but the focus of this period was on Poraver \nto cement ratios. The team had chosen to use Poraver, or recycled expanded glass microspheres, as an aggregate \nas it is extremely lightweight with a specific gravity of 0.39-0.84 depending on the size particle. In addition, \nPoraver\u2019s absorption is 38-42%. Also, since we are able to purchase it by size, we can ensure to meet the RFP \nspecification for the gradation curve of aggregates. An approximate 1:0.5 ratio was established for the cement to \nPoraver, then Phase III commenced. To better understand the selected high \nrange water reducer (ADVA 190) behavior, a short phase was utilized to \ntest the optimum amount to be used. A higher ADVA 190 dosage allowed \nfor a stronger overall mix. This is because the ADVA 190 reduces the \namount of water while also allowing the cement to continue to fully \nhydrate. \nFor Phase IV, the fly ash to cement ratio was varied, prior to this all \nmixes were made with cement only.  The goal was to create a mix in which \nfly ash was greater than 70% of the cementitious material. Additionally, \nthis phase was used to test the difference in quality between Type C and \nType F fly ash (FA). The team concluded that, as predicted, the Type C fly \nash performed at a higher strength than that of the Type F as it has self-\ncementing properties. The team was also able to accomplish the cementitious material ratio through a series of 12 \nbatches. The ratios were tested in progression, starting with 20% FA and 80% cement, then 50% FA and 50% \ncement, then 76% FA and 26% cement. Phase V included a reassessment of the Poraver to cementitious material \nratio given that the binder now consisted largely of fly ash when in Phase II this had not been the case. Steadily \nthe Poraver increased while the cementitious material was decreased. A final ratio of approximately 1:3 \ncementitious material to Poraver was identified. This allocation of materials allowed the team to reach the desired \ndensity and required aggregate by volume ratio. The team ultimately chose to use particles of sizes 0.25-0.5 mm, \n0.5-1 mm, and 1-2mm to meet the RFP and followed ASTM C136 to accurately determine the gradation curve of \nthe aggregates. \nAt this point, our strength started decreasing unexpectedly. Phase VI initiated to investigate the impact of \nour method of cement storage on concrete strength. It was found that our old cement, which had been bought \nseveral months prior and was unprotected from weather, was performing at a lesser strength than that of a newly \npurchased cement.

By \nvarying the proportions of the three ESC sizes, the \nconcrete mix design team found that the ESC mix \nyielded almost a 50% increase in the compressive \nstrength of the baseline mix. However, this substitution \nresulted in a higher unit weight, deviating from the goal \nof keeping the overall canoe weight at around 190 lb. \nA series of mix trials resulted in two different mix \ndesigns containing new aggregate proportions: a ratio \nFigure 5: Grinding Ends of \n2 x 4 in.

Over a \n100-year period, the impacts of CH4 emissions to the \nenvironment are 25 times more harmful than carbon \ndioxide emissions (USEPA 2014).

Class C was chosen over class F \nfly ash because of its ability to develop the high early \nstrengths necessary to demold AQUAFLO after 14 days \nof heated curing (ACI 2014). \nAt the conclusion of the cementitious trials, the \nteam researched the optimal water to cementitious ratio \n(w/cm) for each concrete mix. The ESC and SCBA \nboth absorb large amounts of water, which reduces the \nworkability. To mitigate this problem, the team \nimplemented the use of a polycarboxylate based high \nrange water reducer giving the team the workability it \ndesired for its hand placing efforts.  \nTo further ensure the desired workability of the \nconcrete, the team tested various admixtures, most of \nwhich had been implemented in prior years. In doing \nso, the team was able to focus its attention solely on \nadmixtures that served a meaningful purpose in the \nconcrete mix design. The team chose to use DAREX\u00ae \nAEA, an air entraining admixture, which aided in the \nprocess of entraining the air needed to achieve the \ndesigned air content for the concrete mix. V-MAR3\u00ae, a \nrheology modifier, improved the flow of concrete \nplacement without segregation of the concrete mix. \nWRDA\u00ae 60, a water reducing admixture, assisted with \nthe reduction of theoretical w/cm to achieve a higher \nstrength without adding water.  Lastly, ADVA\u00ae Cast \n600, improved workability and assisted in the cement \nhydration process during the mixing of concrete. \nThe effect of these admixtures on the physical \nproperties of the concrete was tested empirically using \nFigure 6: Outer Layer \nContaining 20% SCBA \na flow table following ASTM C230 (ASTM 2014b). \nThese measurements enabled the team to track concrete \nmix design changes that affected workability (see \nFigure 7).

Hand placing reduced \nthe amount of concrete wasted and made it easier to \nplace concrete on top of the visual inlays. On average, \nusing a pneumatic gun requires 1.5 ft3 of concrete to \ncomplete each layer of the canoe. Comparatively, hand \nplacing only used 0.6 ft3, reducing the amount of \nmaterial and time needed to cast AQUAFLO. All \nconcrete mixes were made by a single concrete mix \ndesign lead using a 1/4 ft3 mixer and followed a \nstandard mixing procedure for each layer. \n \nFigure 8: Aesthetic Inlays \nThe inner layer and aesthetics concrete mix \nused the same mixing procedure. The process began by \ndry mixing the cementitious material, 3M\u00ae K15, and \nmicro-fibers at a low shear setting for thirty seconds. \nThen, the batch water and admixtures, except ADVA\u00ae \nCast 600, were poured into the mixer and mixed at low \nshear for one minute and thirty seconds. Pigments were \nadded to the batch water for the aesthetics concrete \nmix. Next, each mix followed a two minute rest period \nto allow for cement hydration. Finally, the ESC \naggregates and ADVA\u00ae Cast 600 were added into the \nmixer and sheared at medium setting for two minutes. \nThe mixing procedure for the outer layer and structural \nrib mixes differs in that when pouring the batch water, \nthe shearing setting is increased to a medium setting at \nthe one minute mark. Also, thirty seconds of total \nmixing time are added in the final step, helping meet \nthe desired workability. \nAt the beginning of casting day, a meeting was \nheld outlining the expectations for the production of \nAQUAFLO as well as a reminder of the safety \nprocedures for the lab space. The first layer and \nstructural rib mixes were placed progressively onto the \nwooden form to eliminate bonding issues between the \nconcrete mixes. A team of trowelers, whose job was to \napply a smooth finish to the concrete mix, were each \ngiven three different marked pins. The markings were \n1/8 in. for the inner and middle layer, 1/16 in. to \naccount for the visual inlay thickness, and 3/16 in. for \nthe outer layer. Each rib had one carbon fiber piece \nplaced perpendicular to the curvature between two \nparallel pieces of carbon fiber. After the ribs and first \nlayer were completed, two experienced team members \nfollowed the trowelers and inspected the concrete depth \nalong the entire canoe. Immediately after the \ninspection, a sheet of   Kevlar\u24c7 woven carbon fiber \nmesh was laid over the entire canoe and embedded into \nthe concrete. This process of placing a uniformly thick \nlayer of concrete then embedding carbon fiber was \nrepeated for the second layer. \nThe third layer of concrete began at the ends of \nthe canoe and team members progressively troweled \ntowards the middle of the canoe. This placement \nsystem allowed for the visual design team to press the \npre-cut letter inlays onto the outside of the canoe before \nthe concrete hardened. At the conclusion of casting \nday, a large plastic sheeting was placed over the entire \ncanoe to retain the moisture within the concrete before \ninitial curing. \nThe curing tank used from previous years was \nreassembled and properly insulated with polystyrene \nfoam boards and plastic sheeting. The day after casting \nthe canoe, the steel beam was rolled into the curing tank \nand a PVC pipe with drilled holes was placed on top of \nthe \ncanoe. \nSaturated \nlimewater \nwas \npumped \ncontinuously through the pipe onto the canoe at 130 \u00b0F \nand the entire system was enclosed with a plastic tarp.  \nFive days after the start of the initial curing, the \nletter inlays on the outer layer of the canoe were \nremoved, filled with teal pigmented concrete, and the \ncuring process of the canoe was continued.  \nTwo weeks after the canoe casting, the heated \nwater within the curing tank was removed and stored in \na large basin for future reuse. The steel beam was rolled \nout and the form with the canoe were detached from the \nbeam. Each composite piece of the form was cut at the \nribs and carefully removed. The inlays on the inside of \nthe canoe and the exposed end caps were filled with \nconcrete to complete the intricate designs for \nAQUAFLO.

The \nPatch Mix was designed to fill the tiny voids that were too deep to sand away by using only the smallest aggregates \nin the mix. The Black Mix is identical to the Patch Mix except that it contains a black concrete pigment and was \nused to fill in the eyes of Al Capone. \n \nTo reduce the weight of the concrete, the team first considered changing \nthe supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) as well as the amount \nof each SCM in the mixes. When deciding on which SCM to include in \nthe mixes, the mix design team looked at the specific gravities of four \ndifferent materials. Table 10 shows the specific gravities of the \ncementitious materials used in the several mixes. \n \nThe 2016 team decided to test silica fume, which has been overlooked in the past as a possible SCM in the mix \ndesign due to the gray tint it adds to the concrete. This year, since the mix designs contain a concrete pigment, \nthe grayish tint was not problematic. Silica fume is an ultrafine, pozzolanic material that reacts with the calcium \nhydroxide in the cement hydration process to form calcium silicate hydrate, which helps improve the concrete \nstrength (Silica Fume Association, 2005).

After \nmultiple iterations, jacking each cable to a minimum of \n180 pounds eliminated all tensile stress. \nVivace features an improved anchoring design \nwith a custom-made U-shaped bracket to confine the \nconcrete and avoid blowout due to high localized \nstresses at the anchoring location.  \nA major innovation this year was the inclusion \nof a loss reduction system. After jacking, the system \naccounted for the change in strain by moving the anchor \naway from the canoe, counteracting any losses. As a \nfactor of safety, to account for approximately 15% \nlosses caused by strand relaxation and slippage, each \ncable was tensioned to 250 pounds.  \nA total of 1500 pounds of compressive force \nwas added into Vivace, a 150% increase from \nEdgewater, reducing tensile stress by 115 psi under the \ncritical loading. See Figure 6. Using these calculated \ndemands, the mix design team developed a concrete \nmixture that ensures Vivace will withstand any \ncompetition demand.   \nSTRESS CAPACITY / DEMAND\n \nCapacity \nDemand \nF.S. \nComposite Behavior \nShear \n30 psi \n10 psi \n3 \nFlexural \n650 psi \n330 psi \n2 \nCompression \n1800 psi \n110 psi \n16 \n \nCanoe Beam Behavior \nTension \n250 psi \n0 psi \nN/A \nShear \n70 psi \n5 psi \n14 \nFigure 5.

Two types of meshes were used as \nprimary reinforcements. The fiberglass mesh was \nplaced in the hull and curved into gunwales to ensure a \nmonolithic behavior. Strings of carbon fiber mesh were \nplaced in the ribs to provide more resistance. This mesh \nwas not used for the hull\u2019s reinforcement as it is not \nflexible enough to be folded into the gunwales. Using \nthese meshes was a sustainable and economical choice \nas the team already had the material from previous \nyears. PVA fibers incorporated in the mix were \nconsidered as the secondary reinforcement as they \nincrease the tensile strength of the concrete. \nAs rules and regulations regarding the use of \ndye were the same as last years, the team decided to \nrepeat the experiment with engravings and bas-reliefs \nfilled up with concrete color mixes to complete the \ncanoe\u2019s design. Intending to reduce waste of material, \nTrue Lite\u00a9 leftovers were used to develop a non-\nstructural mix which resulted in an aesthetically \npleasing color mix. As leftovers were not sufficient to \nproduce all the concrete color mixes needed, a second \nnon-structural color mix was designed using Norlite\u00a9. \nYoung\u2019s moduli of the structural and non-structural \nconcrete mixes were compared to ensure great \nbehavior and to reduce risk of delamination during \nraces.  \nIn the mindset to improve the quality of its mix \ndesign, the team decided to take a closer look at the \ndistribution of the components in the concrete by \nconducting scanning electron microscopy test. This \ntest allowed the team to verify if the materials were \nproperly spread by analyzing a specific surface of \nconcrete \nusing \nUniversit\u00e9 \nLaval\u2019s \ngeological \nengineering department equipment.  \n \nThe team was able to draw conclusions based \non the spectrum and the microscopic images obtained \nafter several testings.

The main \nproblem in the concrete mix design appeared to be the \nPVA fibers\u2019 distribution. Figure 6 presents the \nmicroscopic image obtained from the test. The team \nconcluded that a better distribution of the fibers would \nallow a better cohesion to the cementitious paste as it \nwould increase the contact area, leading to an increase \nof the flexural resistance and the shear strength. \n \nTo eliminate the PVA fibers\u2019 distribution \nproblem, the team decided to incorporate them \ngradually during the mixing process, instead of all at \nonce. The team also took care to separate them by hand \nbefore they were incorporated in the mix. This \nmodification demonstrated its efficiency as the flexural \nresistance of the new concrete mix was increased \nby 7%.  \nFor a second year, the team decided to conduct \nwater tests to deepen its understanding of hull shapes\u2019 \nbehavior on water. The team focused on analyzing \nmaneuverability and straight-line speed, as they are \ntwo important features for a racing canoe. To do so, last \nyear\u2019s tests were reviewed and improved. Maximus \n(2014)\u2019s and Bluenose V (2015)\u2019s scaled models were \nreused and LavalLand was reproduce as 1:10 scaled \nmodel with the use of a 3D printer.

Indeed, a higher resulting force at the stern \nallows a sharper turn. It resulted that LavalLand was \nthe most efficient canoe for this test, transferring 30% \nof the force applied on the hull by the water jet to its \nstern. Maximus (2014)\u2019s and Bluenose V (2015)\u2019s \ntransferred respectively 11% and 16% of the force \napplied by the water jet.  \nThe second test was performed to determine \nwhich"}

Another relation, linking straight-\nline performance and the force measured by the strain \ngauge fixed on the scaled canoe, was set: for the same \neffort provided by the paddlers, a smaller measured \nforce allows the real canoe to reach a higher straight-\nline speed. Results showed that LavalLand was the \ncanoe having the optimal shape for straight line speed \nperformances. \n \nThis year, the team investigated the paddling \ntechniques to help the paddlers to improve their \nperformances during races.

Respect for tradition is \narguably one of the most prominent characteristics of an Aggie, and is what keeps the Aggie network alive across \nthe globe. This year, the Texas A&M team seeks to utilize its 2022 concrete canoe proposal as a nod to this esteem \nfor tradition through the selection of a Norse mythology theme. \nBeliefs and rituals were paramount and heavily infused into Viking \nculture. The Vikings had no religious texts, so these beliefs were spread through \ntradition and oral storytelling. The Viking belief system was composed of a set \nof myths based on the lives of gods and goddesses, commonly known as Norse \nmythology. These religious stories gave meaning to the Viking\u2019s lives and did \nso in a way that was quite fitting for their time and surroundings. Along with \ntradition, the Vikings had a unique relationship with the sea. This allowed them \nto conquer, trade, and explore a multitude of locations across the world. \nTogether, these features of the Viking Age made Norse mythology a suitable \ntheme for the Texas A&M University Concrete Canoe team. \nLast year\u2019s prototype, Valkyrie, was conceptualized under the theme of Norse mythology, but could not \nbe constructed due to COVID-19 restrictions. This year, the team wanted to carry the theme forward and improve \nupon the prototype devised last year. Valhalla is the great hall where Viking warriors slain in battle were received. \nWith this in mind, the name Valhalla was chosen. This canoe materializes the spirit of discovery and teamwork \nembodied by Texas A&M University\u2019s previous prototype and the Viking people. \nAs the state of Texas lifted COVID-19 restrictions, it was of the utmost importance that the team make \nsignificant advancements in health and safety protocols to ensure members did not fall ill. These advancements \nincluded new N95 respirators, regular hand washing, proper sanitization practices, and online meetings if \nnecessary. As COVID-19 continues to develop and affect everyone\u2019s lives, the team continues to change its \npractices to adhere to CDC guidelines and ensure every member\u2019s safety, \nOn top of member safety, COVID-19 also took a toll on member involvement.

Additionally, the water to cement \nratio of the mix was lowered to further increase strength. Effects to workability from this decrease were offset by \nthe use of water-reducing admixtures.

A total of three \nconcrete mixes could be used this year to construct a prototype. This year, however, only a structural concrete \nmix and an aesthetic mix were utilized. This decision was made to better utilize the available time and materials \nby designing one mix which was both strong and light, with an additional mix used for purely aesthetic purposes. \nThe prototypes constructed in previous years focused on reducing the overall density of the mix through \nthe use of lightweight aggregates. This year, different gradations of Poraver were tested to create an ideal mix for \neach purpose. For the aesthetic mix, Poraver was the only aggregate used in a very fine gradation. This finely \ngraded Poraver was utilized to increase workability for the aesthetic mix.

Since this aggregate was used in previous prototype canoes, the mix design team \nhad an understanding of how it reacted within the concrete matrix. Table 3 highlights the important properties of \neach aggregate material. \n \n \n \n 7 \nFive liquid admixtures were selected for use: Optima 249 high-range water reducer, ControlSet 65 \nhydration controller, Air 260 Ultra air-entraining mixture, Serenis shrinkage reducer, and RECOVER workability \nstabilizer. Water reducing admixtures decreased the water each mix required to achieve the intended workability, \nthereby increasing the strength of the concrete. The hydration controller had similar effects to the water reducer, \nas it retards setting time and reduced the amount of water needed for a desired workability. Air 260 Ultra air-\nentrainer acted as a workability enhancer and decreased the permeability of the set concrete. This ensured that the \nfinal mix was watertight. Additionally, the inclusion of air-entrainer helped to condition the concrete to distribute \nair voids uniformly, thereby reducing air-entrapment. Shrinkage reducers eliminated surface cracking and helped \nprevent water seepage. Lastly, workability-retainers helped with mix quality and ensuring a consistent product \nwith each batch. \nIn recent years, Texas A&M University\u2019s Concrete Canoe team utilized Class C Fly Ash in their concrete \nmix for its desirable properties.

To combat this issue, white silica \nfume was determined to be a suitable replacement due to its similar properties and being a more sustainable \nmaterial to source and utilize. Other cementitious materials chosen this year included Type I Portland Cement; \ngray for the structural mix, and white for the aesthetic mix. Additionally, a metakaolin product known as \nMETAKAO was used as a cementitious material due to its pozzolanic properties and low specific gravity.

The task was split into four \nseparate processes which placed a heavy emphasis on accurate shaping as well as ensuring a professional look to \nthe mold. Stage 1 of the process focused on taking styrofoam and cutting it to a rough shape of the canoe. A total \nof 53 Styrofoam blocks were laid vertically to be cut. Their thicknesses were measured with a caliper and  \nsaved into an Excel spreadsheet. This data was then entered into SolidWorks to \ncreate each cross-section cutout for the foam. Once completed, the cross section \nwas cut using a MegaPlot hot wire EPS cutter and placed to create the rough shape \nof the canoe.  \nStage 2 of the mold creation process focused on sanding down the foam \nto shape the canoe. Since marine tape was placed over the sanded blocks, little \nemphasis was placed on achieving a smooth surface. Rather, it was more \nimportant to ensure a level and uniform surface on which to lay the tape. A max \nof 80 grit sandpaper was used for this process to prioritize time and money. After \ncompletion, marine tape was placed inside the mold to smooth the shape before \nany fiber glass placement occurred. The tape also prevented the fiberglass resin \nfrom coming into contact with the foam and causing it to deteriorate. \nStage 3 involved applying the fiberglass resin and matting to the foam. \nThis process began by spraying the marine tape with a form release oil to ensure \nthat the completed product would detach from the mold. Afterwards, a layer of \nfiberglass resin was placed starting from the spine of the canoe and slowly working up to the gunwales. \nStage 4 was an additional stage conducted to ensure that the quality of the fiberglass mold was up to \nstandards. These standards focused on the mold being smooth, symmetrical, and rigid. Once the fiberglass had \ncured, it was demolded from the foam so that the inside could be inspected. Even with close attention to detail \nduring the application of fiberglass and resin, voids, ridges, and valleys were imprinted in the resin due to \nshrinkage of the marine tape. In order to smooth out these voids, automotive body filler was applied over the \nnewly formed mold and sanded down to create a level surface. It was crucial that the part of the mold in contact \nwith placed concrete be made as smooth as possible, so as to decrease sanding time in the future. \nThe final product was a smooth and rigid fiberglass mold with dimensions that matched the inside of the \nprototype. The ends of the mold did not include the end caps of the canoe. This design choice was made so that \nthe flotation material placed within the bow and stern bulkheads could be more easily installed. \nCanoe"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant that writes proposals for the ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "prompt": "Write the construction section for an ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "output": "sub-teams received the concrete batches and hand placed the \nconcrete onto the mold. First was the inner layer, with a thickness of 5/16\u201d. To \nmaintain consistent thickness, 5/16\u201d depth gauges were tacked to the exterior of \nthe mold before placing concrete.  These depth gauges came in two forms. The \nprimary gauges were small cylindrical concrete markers created the day before \nPlace Day. The concrete used for the markers was identical to that used for the \nboat. Thickness of 5/16\u201d and 5/8\u201d were created, and the markers placed \nsporadically to minimize the effect of cold joints and stress concentrations. The \nsecond type of gauges were known as QC gauges. These were made out of \ntoothpicks and marked with the correct depth measurements for each concrete \nlayer. This gauge was used to check the in-between spaces of the concrete gauges \nto assure a consistent layer thickness throughout.  \nFigure 8: Foam Sanding \nFigure 9: Concrete Placement \n \n \n \n 11 \nAfter completion of the inner layer, basalt mesh reinforcement, which had been cut to shape beforehand, \nwas laid on top and gently massaged into the inner layer. Next, one strand of \u215b\u201d galvanized steel wire was weaved \nthrough the reinforcement from the stern to the bow, around a pulley, and back to the stern. 100 lb of tension was \nplaced onto the wire and anchored into place. Finally, concrete was batched for the outer layer of the canoe, and \nmembers hand placed it on top of the reinforcement layer. Uniform thickness was maintained by using toothpick \ndepth gauges measured to 5/8\u201d. The end caps were comprised of hand sculpted styrofoam encased in a concrete \nlayer approximately 1.0\u201d to 1.5\u201d thick. The thickness at the nose cones was increased for a variety of reasons. \nFirstly, because the styrofoam doubles as additional floatation material, there runs an inherent risk that the high \nbuoyancy of the foam nose cones would cause the concrete to shear at the bulkheads during the Floatation Test. \nTo combat this, extra concrete and reinforcement was placed at the joint between the canoe hull, bow, and stern \nend caps. The second reason for the thicker end caps was the hydrodynamics of the canoe. In the process of \nachieving a shape that would better cut through the water and be the best combination of straight-line speed and \nquick turning capability, more concrete was added to achieve the desired shape with the expectation that heavy \nsanding would decrease the wall thickness to a more uniform value compared to the rest of the canoe. \nTo add design and aesthetics to the canoe, foam stencils were utilized to create grooved designs in the \ncanoe walls. This process was practiced numerous times in the months before Place Day to ensure that the optimal \nstencil designs could be selected. This year several stencils were included in the prototype: one at both the bow \nand stern, and one along the inside of the canoe. The stencils chosen were inspired by Viking or Aggie culture. \nThe stencils were 1/16\u201d thick, and attached to the mold with simple school glue. On the outside of the canoe, \nhomemade wood grain rollers were used to add a wooden texture to the canoe, therefore invoking the image of a \nViking longboat. The inside stencil was made to look like the Tree of Life from Viking culture, and the stencils \non the bow and stern were both A&M inspired, with Ms. Rev and the TAMU block lettering.   \nWith a majority of the team being new members this year, the weeks leading to Place Day were spent \npracticing placing concrete on practice molds. This was done by every member of the team to assure a firm \nunderstanding on how placing was to be performed, and to fine tune the skill.  Experienced members supervised \nthe practices, helping new members become comfortable with the technique. It was observed that the training was \nvery successful, as the placing of the canoe was completed on schedule, even with the inclusion of delays during \nreinforcement installation. \nAfter"}

The purpose of these \nmeetings was to stay on track, plan the next two weeks\u2019 worth of work, push the officers to be more independent \nfrom the captains, and allow the captains to stay informed on the officers\u2019 progress. These meetings became a \ntime to discuss the schedule for the design and build process as well as maintain and readjust as needed. It was \nalso decided to expand the officer team from last year to push the officers to be more autonomous with assigned \nduties and to spread out the workload. After struggling last year in the races, it was deemed necessary to add a \npaddle officer. This was done with the goal of improving the paddling techniques of the team, as well as improving \nthe sprint times.  \nThis year, we also focused more on organization, organizing the entire lab, and creating a schedule throughout \nthe year to remain on time with our deadlines. With this, the team held each other accountable for things that \nshould have been done or should be close to done. Officer meetings played a big role in this approach, the ability \nto set aside an hour and a half of time to discuss ideas and scheduling is very similar to being in the real-world \nFigure 14: Team Bonding \n \n \n14 \ndiscussing ideas to maintain a schedule.

The chapter also hosts \nweekly general member meetings, along with \ncoordinating an average of four large events every \nacademic year. \nThe first event of the year organized and hosted by \nthe University\u2019s student chapter was the annual Civil \nand Environmental Engineering Career Fair, which \nwas held virtually this year. This career fair is unique \nto the department in that all the companies that are \ninvited to the fair are searching for civil and/or \nenvironmental engineers. The career fair is paid for \nand organized by the ASCE Student Chapter. This \nevent helps students in the department find \ninternships and brings professionalism to campus. \n \nThe ASCE Student Chapter at Michigan also hosts a \nSpeaker Series. The Speaker Series luncheons occur \nevery Friday and are part of the weekly general \nmember meetings. They have been a staple within \nthe department for several years and attract a group \nof 20-40 people consisting of undergraduate and \ngraduate students from all civil and environmental \nengineering concentrations, as well as a handful of \nprofessors. This year due to COVID-19, the chapter \ndecided to continue the series in a virtual format. The \nseries also provides an opportunity for companies to \nrecruit and introduce themselves to students and \ncreate a presence on campus. The presentations \nthemselves are generally a mix of a technical \nengineering presentation and a fun, behind-the-\nscenes look at projects that the speaker has worked \non.

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant that writes proposals for the ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "prompt": "Write the development and testing section for an ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "output": ", and collaboration enabled MCCT \nto achieve its goals for the season.  \n \n \nFigure 3. Mix 6 of the 8 mixed that were tested. \n \nROWMAINE\u2019s mix is based on KEPLER\u2019s mix \ndesign as it demonstrated desirable strengths, \nbuoyancy, and did not incorporate latex[8]. The \ngreatest challenge in producing this year\u2019s mix was \neliminating all manufactured microspheres as \nrequired by the RFP and finding suitable \nreplacements that would maintain a low density and \nhigh strength. \n \nThe mix subteam tested many different ratios of \ncementitious materials for the KEPLER mix and thus \nfelt confident in preserving those materials and \nproportions for ROWMAINE. VCAS\u2122 160 is a \npozzolanic material and was used at a greater wt.% \ncompared to other cementitious materials. It had \nconsiderable contributions to the compressive and \ntensile strengths of the concrete and has a lower \nspecific gravity, hence reducing the density of the \nmix[9]. The next cementitious material included was \nGGBFS 120, a lightweight and sustainable \nalternative to portland cement that improves the \nworkability of the concrete in the absence of \nlatex[10][11]. Class C fly ash is another pozzolanic \nmaterial chosen as a replacement for portland \ncement; it is desirable due to its low specific gravity, \nenvironmentally \nsustainable \nproperties, \nand \ncontributions to the strength of the concrete. It also \nreduced shrinkage, lowered water demand, improved \nworkability, \nand \nreduced \npermeability \nand \nabsorption[12]. Komponent\u00ae was incorporated into \nthe mix in the same proportion as it was for KEPLER \nto minimize shrinkage cracking during curing[8][13]. \n \nNew aggregate rules prohibited the use of \nmanufactured microspheres and required at least \n50% of aggregate volume to consist of ASTM C330 \ncompliant aggregate and/or recycled concrete \naggregate (RCA). The subteam performed extensive \nresearch into new rule-compliant aggregates, \nultimately including Buildex Expanded Shale and \nCityMix Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) in the mix for \nthe first time this year in addition to Haydite Shale. \nHaydite was used in previous years\u2019 mixes and was \nmaintained in ROWMAINE\u2019s mix design as it \nprovides substantial strength to the concrete, with the \nadded benefit of a low specific gravity, which is why \nthe team chose to use it as a primary natural \naggregate in the concrete[14]. \n \nNorlite, a lightweight aggregate first used in \nKEPLER\u2019s mix, was incorporated into the mix \ndesign again this year. Norlite has a specific gravity \ncomparable to that of Haydite and it contributes to \nthe strength, density reduction, and sustainability of \nthe concrete mix. Norlite also has a high absorption \ncapacity, which aids the internal curing process[15]. \nDue to Haydite having a slightly lower specific \ngravity than Norlite, the volume of Norlite used in \nthe mix was decreased in favor of Haydite. \n \nThe subteam also adopted Buildex, which has a \nsimilar composition to Haydite but \nhas a \nsignificantly lower specific gravity and higher \nabsorption capacity[16]. Despite these benefits, the \nteam was still conservative with the amount of \nBuildex added because it had a larger particle size. \nThis has an adverse effect on the smooth gradation \nof the mix. A smoother gradation minimizes the total \nvolume of voids between aggregates, improving the \nworkability of the mix[17]. \n \nCityMix EPS beads are another new aggregate \nincorporated into ROWMAINE\u2019s mix design. Of all \nthe aggregates used in the mix, CityMix has the \nlowest specific gravity and absorption capacity and \nconsists of 99% recycled content by volume, \nimproving the sustainability of the mix[18]. The foam \nbeads were primarily chosen as a replacement for the \nPoraver\u00ae, K20, and SG-300 used in previous years\u2019 \nmixes, as the specific gravity and absorption capacity \nis very similar. However, a decrease in strength is \nattributed to an increase in CityMix volume, so the \nmajority of the aggregate strength contribution \ncomes from the Haydite, Buildex, and Norlite. \n \n \n8 \n \nTable 3: Aggregate Properties. \nAggregate Composition \nSSD \nSpecific \nGravity \nAbs \n(%) \nParticle \nSize (in.) \nBuildex \nShale \nExpanded \nShale \n1.34 \n12 \n0.125-0.25 \nHaydite \nExpanded \nShale \n1.56 \n9.2 \n0-0.187 \nNorlite \nCeramic Shale \n1.66 \n7 \n0-0.187 \nCityMix \nExpanded \nPolystyrene \n0.05 \n0 \n0-0.125 \n \nThe team incorporated internal curing in KEPLER\u2019s \nmix as an innovative way to increase the strength of \nthe concrete; however, limited accessibility to the \nteam project space under COVID-19 restrictions \nprevented the execution of this method[8]. Despite \nthis setback, the mix subteam still developed a plan \nto re-use this method for the 2022 season. The \nHaydite and Norlite would be soaked for 48 hours \nand then drained for 24 hours before mixing to \nachieve saturated, surface dry (SSD) conditions. This \nabsorption by the aggregates aids in the hydration \nprocess and replaces any moisture lost from \nevaporation. Data about the absorptivity of the \naggregates would be used to calculate the amount of \nwater necessary for sufficient soaking[14]. The \nvolume of water added to the aggregates during this \nSSD conditioning step must then be subtracted from \nthe total volume of water needed during the mixing \nprocess. Internal curing promotes hydration of the \nmix throughout the entire canoe cross-section, which \nsaturates the pores in the cement paste and prevents \nearly age shrinkage and cracking. As KEPLER\u2019s mix \nand ROMAINE\u2019s mix both included higher amounts \nof pozzolanic cementitious materials, the internal \ncuring process serves to meet the additional water \ndemand required. Additionally, internal curing helps \nto lower the permeability of concrete[19]. This curing \nmethod has been found to improve many qualities of \nthe concrete mix and the subteam intends it to be an \nessential part of the design process during the 2022 \nseason. \n \nThe addition of PVA fibers prevents plastic \nshrinkage cracking in the concrete mix. An effective \nquantity of fibers was determined in 2018\u2019s mix for \nMAJESTY and was retained in the 2021 mix[20]. The \nfibers were dosed at 6.5 lb/yd3 and a combination of \n6 mm, 8 mm, and 12 mm sizes were used [21][22][23]. \n \nThe amount of high range water reducer incorporated \ninto the mix was maintained at the same amount \nadded for KEPLER. Water reducer increases the \nworkability of the mix without significantly \nincreasing the water usage and consequently \ndecreasing the strength of the concrete. Many mixes \nwith different dosages of air entrainer were tested last \nyear and evaluated based on density and air content. \nIt was determined that a 30 fl oz/cwt dosage of air \nentrainer optimized these properties in KEPLER, and \nthus this dosage was repeated for ROWMAINE\u2019s \nmix[8]. In addition, to maintain a low density while \npreventing water from penetrating the concrete, the \nSILRES BS 6920 sealer chosen last year will be used \non the finished product. MCCT also chose this sealer \nbecause it dries to a glossy finish, providing a \ndesirable aesthetic appearance to the canoe[24]. \n \nDue to limited access to MCCT\u2019s project center, the \nteam was not able to perform sufficient"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant that writes proposals for the ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "prompt": "Write the construction section for an ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "output": ". \n \nMethodology of Mixing Concrete  \nPrior to mixing, the mix subteam members measure \nout all of the cementitious materials, aggregates, \nadmixtures and fibers. The cementitious materials \nare then added to the mixing bowl, followed by the \naggregates, which reduces the likelihood of the \nheavier natural aggregates sticking to the bottom of \nthe bowl once mixing begins. Finally, the air \nentrainer is poured directly into the mix; this method \nof adding air entrainer was decided upon during the \n2019 mix design process because it was found to \nmaximize air content[25]. The mixing process then \nbegins in the team\u2019s Hobart D300 mixer, with water \nbeing added in intervals. Roughly ten seconds into \nmixing, the fibers are added. Once roughly 75% of \nthe mix\u2019s required water has been added, the water \nreducer is poured in, followed by the remainder of \nthe water. The mixing process is complete once the \nconcrete appears saturated. \n \nPlacement of Concrete & Reinforcement \nThe placement of concrete and reinforcement for \nROWMAINE would follow the scheme the team has \n \n10 \n \nused in previous years, which was named the \n\u201cChasing Method\u201d. Implementing this method \nallows several team members to carry out different \ntasks along the length of the canoe simultaneously.  \n \nCasting would begin with a \u215c in. thick layer of \nconcrete being applied to the mold. Several members \nperform this task to place this layer down the length \nof the canoe, followed by a second team laying 2 ft. \npre-cut sections of fiberglass mesh. The second \nlayering team would be close behind, applying the \nsecond \u215c in. layer of concrete. The finishing team \nwould then follow, working with trowels and spray \nwater bottles to establish the smoothness of the canoe \nexterior and limit any delamination problems. \nMCCT expects that this method would produce an \nexceptional final product as it has in the past.  \n \n \nFigure 4. Concrete placement and layering scheme \non casting day for KEPLER[8]. \nCuring  \nMCCT plans to utilize the same wet curing method \nfor ROWMAINE as was used for KEPLER. This \nprocess would take place in the Wilson Student Team \nProject Center paint booth, which has a consistent \nambient temperature of 70\u00b0F, providing a favorable \ncuring environment. MCCT members would place \ndamp sheets on the canoe to initiate the curing \nprocess and maximize concrete strength. The sheets \nwould then be saturated and replaced every 12 hours \nfor 28 days. Internal curing is implemented early in \nthe canoe making process by soaking the Haydite and \nNorlite for 48 hours and draining for 24 hours to \nproduce saturated, surface dry (SSD) conditions \nprior to mixing. This method improves the strength, \nreduces the risk of shrinkage, and minimizes the \npermeability of the final product. \n \nForm Removal & Concrete Finishing  \nOn casting day, MCCT would apply the water-based \nrelease agent used for the first time on KEPLER to \nthe entire mold for ROWMAINE. This water-based \nrelease agent was chosen over oil-based alternatives \nbecause it is a more sustainable option. The release \nagent would be applied to the canoe with air spray \nguns in the paint booth. \n \nAfter curing, the exterior of the canoe would be \nsanded. The mold would then be removed from the \ncanoe interior by flipping the canoe and resting it on \nfemale mold pieces for support. The first piece of the \nmold would be levered out at the stern, and then the \nrest would be removed. Afterward, the interior of the \ncanoe is sanded. The mold pieces would be saved for \nfuture transportation support, possible use in foam \nbulkheads, and practice sections. \n \nIn the event that the experimental density of the mix \nis higher than the anticipated density, the placement \nof concrete over 36 in. foam bulkheads will be a new \naddition to ROWMAINE. The foam bulkheads will \nprovide additional buoyancy required for the canoe. \nTo maintain sustainable practices, MCCT would cut \nthe desired volume of foam from the ends of the mold \npost-demolding. These foam ends would be inserted \nat the bow and stern of ROWMAINE. Once in place, \nthe mold sections would be encapsulated in a \u00bd in. \nthick layer of concrete. The concrete over each foam \ncap would then be wet cured following the same \nprocess as the body of the canoe. Once the entirety \nof the canoe had cured, the team would carry out the \nfinishing process.  \n \nMCCT expects that the innovations of previous years \nbeing implemented on ROWMAINE will improve its \ninitial finish once cured. However, sanding will still \nbe necessary. The Finishing Lead would organize \nsanding sessions, before and after demolding, to sand \nthe interior and exterior of the canoe. The sanding \nwould be done in an enclosed tent with the proper \nventilation. The finishing team would start sanding \nwith 80 grit paper and work up to 320 grit paper.  \n \n \n11 \n \nAesthetics \nMCCT plans to utilize several pigmented structural \nconcrete mixes. The different colors will be used on \ncasting day to create aesthetic designs on the interior \nand exterior of the canoe, respectively. After final \nsanding, two coats of SILRES BS 6920 sealer will be \napplied to the entirety of the vessel."}

Members can join \nmultiple subteams and stay engaged on their own \nterms. This structure allows members to contribute \nin meaningful ways while exploring which subteam \nbest suits their interests. The team\u2019s structure also \nclearly defines the responsibilities of leadership \nroles. \n \nQuality Control and Quality Assurance \nMCCT\u2019s quality control and quality assurance \nprogram is led by the Quality Control Officer of the \nteam. This person is the lead on all quality assurance \ndevices and is an expert on the RFP released by \nASCE. The Quality Control Officer reviews the \ndetails of the RFP and relays the relevant information \nto each subteam lead through individual meetings. \nThis member is also in charge of informing the team \nof the RFIs released by ASCE as well as addendums \nto the RFP. \n \nOne of the main events the QA/QC team prepares for \nis casting day. This is the day when the team meets \nand makes the canoe. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, \nresulting in a full-scale canoe not being made, the \nteam was unable to practice typical quality assurance \nprocedures such as weighing aggregates to make sure \nthat they fall within the specified weight category. \nUsually, ideas for quality assurance devices are \nbrainstormed by the entire team for casting day. The \n \n12 \n \nmain concerns for casting day are keeping the \nthickness consistent throughout the canoe and \nkeeping the keel line straight. One of the quality \nassurance devices used are nails painted at two \ndifferent levels, one for each layer of concrete. This \nallows the team to test for the thickness of the laid \ndown concrete for its uniformity during casting. \n \nAdditionally, for quality assurance, the team planned \nto use foam tape of 3/8 in. thickness, the desired \ndepth of one layer, to guide the layering procedure \nalong the mold from bow to stern. Sections of \nconcrete would be placed down with the tape moving \nalong the length of the canoe. Finally, wooden \ndowels and string were secured at the bow and stern \nof the canoe, making a line that marked the keel. This \nis a useful guide for the finishing subteam to follow \nwhen troweling the canoe. \n \nFor quality control measures, MCCT will swamp test \nthe canoe prior to product delivery. This will \ndemonstrate that the design and implementation \nstrategy are viable to deliver a final product that \nmeets the design specifications. \n \nSustainability \nSustainability on the team took a different form this \nyear, as MCCT wanted to incorporate it directly into \nthe theme. ROWMAINE has been cultivated with the \nidea of local food in mind. The University of \nMichigan has made significant progress toward \nagricultural sustainability regarding locally grown \nproduce. Similarly, sustainability has been accounted \nfor in the physical design of ROWMAINE. The mixes \nthat \nwere \ndesigned \nand \ntested \nutilized \nenvironmentally friendly materials such as GGBFS \nand fly ash, which act as replacements for portland \ncement and require significantly less energy to \nproduce. Additionally, the EPS foam used in the mix \nis manufactured from 99% recycled material. In the \nmold preparation process, the release agent used to \nremove the canoe from the mold is water based \ninstead of oil based. To obtain some of the needed \nmaterials, the team utilized local vendors, resulting \nin lower transportation emissions due to their \nproximity to campus. The mostly virtual format of \nthis year\u2019s activities also resulted in less carbon \nemissions from transportation to meetings, paddling \npractices and competition events. In addition, far less \nvolatile organic compounds were released due to the \ninability to mix and cast a canoe this year. \nMCCT has also continued to develop new ways to \nimprove the sustainability of the team\u2019s structure and \npractices. The mix design subteam introduced the \nnew role of the mix design assistant during the 2020 \nseason and further refined the role this year. The \npurpose of this role is to reduce the workload of the \nmix design lead and make the assistant more familiar \nwith the mix design process. The member appointed \nto this position works closely with the mix design \nlead to develop mixes and run subteam meetings, \nwith the long term goal of succeeding the lead \nposition the following year. \n \n \nFigure 5.

Out first criterion this year was to \nfind a suitable substitute for the aggregate \nPoraver\u00ae expanded glass in order to conform to \nthe 2021 RFP which states that expanded glass \nmicrospheres are not permitted (Exhibit 5). Mixes \npreviously utilized by the team had a large \npercentage by volume of the expanded glass \nspheres. Therefore, intensive changes would have \nto be made to our baseline mix. Our next goal \nwas to increase the amount of ASTM C330 \naggregate in our mix so that it would constitute at \nleast 50% of the total aggregate volume. Our team \nhas used Haydite\u00ae Expanded Shale aggregate as \na C330 aggregate in previous years, meaning we \nwould simply have to adjust the proportion. With \nthese restrictions in mind, we aimed to create a \nconcrete mix with high strength and low weight.   \nAggregates considered for this mix included \nHaydite\u00ae Expanded Shale (ASTM C330), and \nHess Perlite, Grade 190E (ASTM C 549). Both \naggregates were sieved so that the particles fell \nbetween the No. 4 sieve and No. 200 sieve. Hess \nPerlite was selected as the most viable option for \nreplacing Poraver\u00ae expanded glass due to its \nextremely low SGOD of .088, and SGSSD of .22. \nAfter mechanically changing the gradation, \nHaydite\u00ae Expanded shale has an SGOD of .8, \nan SGSSD of 0.9, and an absorption rate of \n12.5%. In the 2019-2020 project cycle, the team \nidentified that as the fraction of aggregate volume \noccupied by Haydite\u00ae increased, so did the \nstrength.  This knowledge, combined with that of \nfrom Enhanced Focus Area A, led the mix team to \n \n \n11 \n \nproportion expanded shale and perlite evenly by \nvolume in Engineer Fuel \u2019s mix.  \nPozzolans and cementitious materials selected for \nthe mix include VCAS-MicronHS (ASTM C \n618), White portland cement (ASTM C 150), and \nSlag Cement (ASTM C 989). Pozzolans are \nnaturally occurring and of volcanic origin. They \nare a class of siliceous and aluminous materials \nwhich react chemically with calcium hydroxide to \nform \ncompounds \npossessing \ncementitious \nproperties. According to the manufacturer, the \npozzolan selected for this mixture has a specific \ngravity of 2.6, and is made from Vitrified \nCalcium Aluminio-Silicate material which has \nlow alkali content, consistent chemistry, uniform \ncolor and a wholly amorphous state (Vitro \nMinerals). Next in the mix is White portland \ncement with a SG of 3.15. White portland cement \nis very similar to normal portland cement in that \nit is a fine powder, produced by heating limestone \nand clay minerals in a kiln to form clinker. The \nclinker is then ground and combined with a small \namount of gypsum. The pure white color is \npreferable to basic portland cement because it \nallows the powdered dye to exhibit full vibrancy. \nSlag cement is a hydraulic cement that was paired \nwith \nwhite \nportland \ncement. \nThis hydraulic cement has a specific gravity of \n2.94 and is a byproduct of iron production.  \nThe selected admixtures this year were MAPEI\u00ae \nPolychem VRC (ASTM C260) and MAPEI KB \n1200 (ASTM C 494). Polychem VRC is an air \nentraining admixture which was chosen for its \nability \nto \ndecrease \ndensity \nby \ntrapping \nmicroscopic \nair \nbubbles \nin \nthe \nconcrete \nmixture. The presence of these air bubbles \nthroughout the mixture increases freeze-thaw \ndurability, reduces bleeding and segregation of \nthe material, and increases the workability.  KB \n1200, a water reducer, was used in order to help \ndecrease the batch water needed to provide proper \nworkability without sacrificing the strength of the \nconcrete mixture. Water reducer has the ability to \ndecrease the water content of cement by 5-10%. It \nalso decreases the porosity and the permeability \nof the surface, increases strength up to 25%, and \nincreases the workability of the mix. It is \nimportant to select the proper quantity of each \nadmixture. For example, too much air entrainer \ncan cause the concrete to weaken due to a higher \npercentage of air voids, and too much water \nreducer can make a mix have too much slump. \nEither of these cases could ruin an otherwise \nviable mix.  The dosages chosen in the 2019-2020 \nproject cycle were considered optimal for our \ndesired strength/density ratio, therefore, 8.5% for \nPolychem VRC and 10.5% for KB 1200 were \nmaintained in the current mix.  \nThe reinforcement layering scheme chosen for the \nprototype was one layer of fiberglass mesh as \nprimary reinforcement spanning the entire length \nof the canoe. This design was selected to reduce \nthe possibility of concrete not fully adhering \nbetween multiple layers. One layer of the mesh \nensures that both layers of concrete can properly \nadhere without weakening the overall design. The \nsecondary reinforcement material selected for the \nmix was Anti-Crak HD glass fibers (ASTM \nC1116). Fiberglass fibers add additional strength \nin tension, an inherent weakness of concrete as a \nmaterial, without adding too much additional \nweight.  The fibers have a SG of 2.68.   \nUsing previous knowledge of mixture materials in \nconjunction with data gathered during completion \nof Enhanced Focus Area A, the mix team was able \nto make educated decisions regarding the \nproportions of Engineer Fuel\u2019s mix. Poraver\u00ae \nexpanded glass was substituted with Hess Perlite, \nand the quantity of Haydite\u00ae expanded shale was \nincreased in order to comply with the RFP. Even \n \n \n12 \n \nthrough fundamental changes in the mix \nregulations, we were able to formulate a light mix \nwith higher strength and a more simplistic \nformula than in years past."}

Each \ncross-section is secured to the base by screws \ninserted vertically from the base into the cross-\nsection. At each rib location, a 1\u201d thick foam \ncross-section is pinched between two wooden \ncross-sections with a 1\u201d inset from the mold \nsurface. Foam is also cut at decreasing size \nintervals at the bow and stern and then filed to the \ndesired shape of the hull. This aspect assists the \ncanoe\u2019s buoyancy and serves to offset the \nstructural aggregate\u2019s relatively high specific \ngravity.  \nTo stabilize the cross-sections, recycled 2x4s are \naffixed perpendicularly, preventing deflections on \nthe cantilevered end. Once structurally sound, \nlarge sheets of paper are used to outline each 1\u2019 \ncross-section, which are then transferred over to \nsheets of fiber reinforced plastic (FRP). This \nFRP is cut and filed in an attempt to create a \nsmooth seam between each piece.

This method enables the team to apply \nthe concrete within six hours.  \nDuring the application process, two layers of \nconcrete will be placed (the first with a thickness \nof 5/16\u201d, and the second with a thickness \nof 7/16\u201d) with a fiberglass mesh separating them, \ngiving a total thickness of 3/4\u201d (sanding would \nreduce this by about 1/8\u201d for a final thickness of \n\u215d\u201d).

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant that writes proposals for the ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "prompt": "Write the hull design and structural analysis section for an ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "output": ". These desired \nchanges necessitated a new mold to cast Sugar Rush.  \nThree \ndifferent \nhull \niterations \nwere \nconsidered: proportionally scaling the width to match \nthe 0.5 foot length reduction, keeping the width and \nshape of the stern the same as from La Sirena\u2019s, or \ninterpolating the width change from the previous two \noptions. The latter option was selected based on \nresults from CFD performed using ANSYS Fluent \nmodelling. Drag coefficient in straight and angled \norientations were the primary parameters considered. \nThis hull was found to increase maneuverability \nwithout radically affecting the straight-line top speed \nof the canoe. The max width of Sugar Rush\u2019s mold is \n28\u201d, which is 0.25\u201d less than that of La Sirena. The \nmaximum width is located 12 feet from the tip of the \nbow to retain the same approximate \u2154 ratio of La \nSirena to reduce wavemaking and essentially \ndescrease resistance (McGuffin 1999). \n Many of the properties from La Sirena were \nincluded in Sugar Rush. The 5\u201d chine radius of La \nSirena was reused for the provided secondary \nstability which aids paddlers when executing tight \ncornering and to prevent capsizing (McGuffin 1999). \nThis sacrifices the greater primary stability of a \nsmaller chine radius, but was deemed acceptable due \nto paddler familiarity with the 5\u201d chine. The same \nflared walls were translated from La Sirena onto \nSugar Rush. The outward-flaring gunwales were also \nkept the same to provide concrete cover for the pre-\ntensioning (PT) cables and mitigate water entry. \nAdditionally, they provide stability and durability for \nthe walls and canoe as a whole. Sugar Rush also has \nthe same moderate rocker as La Sirena which \nfeatures a short waterline length, optimized wetted \nsurface area, which results in less drag and greater \nmaneuverability (Jackson 1995). \nThe prismatic coefficient (PC) is the ratio of \nthe volume of a canoe to that of a prism created by \nprojecting its largest cross-section across its length, \nand it quantifies how evenly the volume is distributed \nalong the hull. A high PC indicates a uniform and \nbuoyant canoe that generates minimal wavemaking \nresistance, while a low PC characterizes a canoe that \nencounters less wetted surface area resistance and \nprovides limited paddler space (Slade 1998). The \nmost efficient PC for a canoe correlates with its speed \nto length ratio (SLR), and the ideal PC for Sugar \nRush\u2019s expected SLR of 1.2 is 0.580. Sugar Rush\u2019s \nactual PC of 0.545 deviates 6.0 percent from this \nideal, as compared to La Sirena\u2019s PC of 0.587, which \nexhibited a 1.2 percent deviation. The increased \ndeviation in PC of Sugar Rush reflects the decision to \nprioritize turning ability over top speed by decreasing \nthe length without proportionally decreasing the \nwidth. Sugar Rush\u2019s increased PC is better optimized \nto handle the redesigned slalom course, which \nenables it to balance resistance forces and increased \nturning ability (Kasten 1997). \nTable 4: The Jabberwock, La Sirena, and Sugar Rush hull performance indicators \n \nEl Fey \n(2016) \nThe Jabberwock \n(2017) \nSugar Rush \n(2019) \nReason(s) for change/ \nretention \nOverall \nLength \n19.5\u2019 \n19.5\u2019 \n19.0\u2019 \nDecreased to increase turning ability and reduce frictional forces \nMax. \nWidth \n2\u2019-6.38\u201d \n2\u2019-6.38\u201d \n2\u2019-6\u201d \nDecreased to maintain general canoe shape due to length decrease \nChine \nRadius \n4\u201d \n5\u201d \n5\u201d \nMaintained for optimal secondary stability \nKeel fin at \nbow \nIncluded \nNot included \nNot included \nDecrease wetted surface area and reduce drag force during turns"}

An average estimate \nwas calculated for the weight of the paddlers, which \nwas used as a point load with a safety factor of 1.26 \ntimes their actual weight.

CH, a \nproduct of the cement hydration reaction, contributes \nvery little to strength whereas C-S-H produces the \nbinding phase that gels  concrete components \ntogether. This structurally enhancing effect comes \nwith minimal cost to the environment because VCAS \nand NewCem are byproducts of the glass-fiber and \nsteel industries respectively, meaning no additional \nCO2 was released in their production.

Although this led to an \nincreased budget and a tighter schedule, this change \nwas seen as an essential improvement to create a \ncompetitive final product.  \nDue to transport limitations, the mold was \nscheduled to arrive in two separate pieces. A dogbone \ndesign was used to cut the mold in half to prevent \nmovement \nin \nthe \nx \nand \ny \ndirection \nupon \nrecombination, and secured in the z direction with the \naid of bonding adhesive. The back tip of the mold \nrequired a higher degree of precision, so it was cut \nmanually and sanded by hand. The front tip of the \nmold was cut to a fine point as per the specifications, \nand was then sanded down and thickened with plaster \nto be more durable. After the adhesive set, plaster \nwas applied to the mold to fill any small abrasions \nand cracks and ensure a completely level surface. \nThen the mold was covered with two coats of paint \nand two coats of epoxy to provide a hard casting \nsurface. Finally, contact paper was spread over the \nentirety of the mold as a final layer of smoothness \nand wooden blocks were then glued 1\u201d from the sides \nof the mold to create gunwale forms. \n \nFollowing last year\u2019s method, Sugar Rush \nwas pre-tensioned (PT). In order to conserve \nresources, the same PT stands from last year were \nreused with slight modifications to fit the dimensions \nof the new mold.

The \nincreased width of the stand was successful in \nrepositioning the point where the wires crossed paths \ncloser to the tip of the mold. Pre-tensioning allowed \nfor the team to cast the bow within the timeframe of \ncasting day, saving time and enabling unity along the \nentire canoe by preventing cold joints. \nTo prepare for casting day, the team held \nthree practice casts throughout fall quarter. Keeping \nin line with the goal to conserve foam and other \nresources, the previous year\u2019s mold was used for the \npractice casts, and casting was limited to a 4 ft \nmidsection of the canoe. The first practice cast helped \nfamiliarize new members with concrete and the \nproper way to handle it. The second practice cast \ntested the various colors of the candy designs. The \nthird practice cast focused on efficiency, covering an \nadditional two feet of the practice mold, within a 2 \nhour casting window. \nThis year, Casting Day was scheduled on a \nSaturday to make use of the increased availability of \nstudents. Without any classes to disrupt work, project \nmembers were able to work for an extended period of \ntime, providing a more seamless casting experience, \nand allowing Casting Day to be completed in 8 hours \nwith 44 project members in attendance. Volunteers \nwere divided into teams\u2014 concrete production, \naesthetics, depth checking and general casting\u2014 \nbased on experience from practice casts.

The truncation of the stern allows for \nflow separation at the sharp transition of the transom, \nresulting in a depression that acts as an extension of the \ncanoe length (Maki 2006). This extension increases the \neffective waterline length without exceeding the \nmaximum 22 ft. length requirement (ASCE/NCCC \n2016).   \n    The final product measured 21 ft. 6 1/2 in. in length \nand 27 3/4 in. in width. While these modifications to \nthe ForeverGlades hull may not allow Category 6 to \nmatch a hurricane\u2019s winds of 75 mph, it does increase \nturning capability and stability.  \n    Category 6 was analyzed to withstand five potential \nloading cases.

A by-product of \nthe iron manufacturing industry, slag lowers \nthe water demand allowing for a significant \nreduction of the w/cm ratio, which highly \nimproves strengths (ACI 233-03, Ferraro \n2009, Roy 1982).  \n    The baseline aggregate gradation and two \nalternatives were tested after creating a \ngradation \ncurve \nin \nMicrosoft \nExcel \n(Microsoft 2010). A trial mix was created \nusing a gradation consisting of only S38 and \nK15 glass microspheres because of their low \nspecific gravity. Poraver\u00ae hollow glass \nspheres, with a diameter of 0.1-0.5 mm, were  \ntested in a second trial based on balancing a gradation \ncurve between the predicted unit weight and closeness \nto the Federal Highway Administration 0.45 power \ncurve (FHWA 1996). Both trials did not match or \nexceed the strength of the aggregate gradation of the \nForeverGlades\u2019 mix (University of Florida 2015) and \nwere rejected.  The baseline aggregate gradation was \nselected and includes three diameter ranges of Poraver\u00ae \n(0.25-0.5, 0.5-1.0, 1.0-2.0 mm), and the two diameter \nranges of glass microspheres, S38 and K15.   \n    Employing five different types of admixtures \nresulted in acceptable compressive and tensile \nstrengths while creating the desirable workability for \nshotcreting and hand-placing casting techniques.

Air-entrainment \nis recommended by the American Concrete Institute \n(ACI 213-03) in most lightweight concretes; therefore, \nthe team used DAREX\u00ae air entraining admixture to \ndecrease the unit weight. Styrene-butadiene rubber \n(SBR) latex prevents crack propagation by bridging \nmicro-cracks with polymer films, increasing air \nentrainment, and helping to increase workability \n(Ohama 1995). Approximately 15% of mix trials were \ndedicated to fine tuning the w/cm ratio to maximize the \nuse of two admixtures, ADVA\u00ae Cast 600 and WRDA\u00ae \n60, within manufacturer's specification. This was \naccomplished by reducing the w/cm ratio based on \npredicted water demand reduction of 12-20% (ACI \n1979). \n    The concrete mix team attempted to reduce the air \nentrainer DAREX\u00ae and increase the amount of latex \nutilized in a mix since the use of air entrainers \nconcurrently with SBR latex is not recommended \n(Ohama 1995). Increasing latex improved tensile \nstrength but negatively affected the compressive \nstrength, persuading the team to remain at 5% latex \nalongside an air entrainer.   \n    The team used 30% of trials to test pigments and \ndetermine the effects on concrete properties and on mix \nproportions. Liquid and powdered pigments were \ntested to determine their effect on strength. Powdered \npigment was chosen because of its minimal variance in \nstrength.

During the NCCC, it was \nnoticed that Redemption (2017) was lethargic in the \nraces compared to its competitors. After conducting \nresearch, it was found that a symmetrical hull \ndesign, similar to the one used for Redemption \n(2017), has this characteristic (Brewer 1994). For \nthis reason, the apex of Ascension was moved 6 \ninches toward the stern. This change made \nAscension less lethargic and increased propensity \nfor turning, a characteristic that is not desired by the \nteam (Boy Scouts 2014). In order to combat this, \nthe bow rocker was decreased to 5 inches.  \n     One final change that was made was the \nimplementation of a rounded ledge versus the \nsquare ledge used in all Pitt Johnstown canoes from \nPhantom (2013) to Redemption (2017). The \nrounded ledge will decrease stress concentrations in \nthe ledge. In the past the square ledge had been a \nvery delicate part of the canoe. Figure 2 shows a \ncomparison between Redemption (2017) and \nAscension at the middle of the canoe.  \n \n \n \n \n      \n    Three ribs were utilized in Ascension as paddler \nfootholds, with secondary benefits as structural \ncomponents. The location of theses ribs remained \nthe same as Redemption (2017) due to satisfaction \nabout their location expressed by the paddlers. The \nlength of the bulkheads was shortened in \nAscension. A buoyancy calculation was done by \nsumming the cumulative mass of the canoe with the \nbulkheads and the cumulative volume with the \nbulkheads. This calculation was iterated in \nMicrosoft Excel\u00ae until a density less than 62.4 pcf \nwas obtained.

Due to it being the only \nPitt Johnstown mix that has met the requirement for \n25% by volume of ASTM C330 aggregate, the \nstructural mix used in Redemption (2017) was used \nas a baseline.  \n     The baseline mix contained cementitious \nmaterials which were 41% type III white portland \ncement, 36% class C fly Ash, and 23% Optipozz. \nThe aggregates in the baseline were 70% Poraver\u00ae \nin sizes of 0.1-0.3 mm, 0.5-1.0 mm, and 1.0-2.0 \nmm, 22% grade 5 pumice, and 8% Haydite with \ngrade 5 pumice and Haydite being used as the \nASTM C330 compliant materials. The mix also \nincluded ASTM C1116 polypropylene fibers as \nsecondary reinforcement within the concrete mix \n(Redemption 2017).  \n     Before mix iterations for Ascension were made, \nthe specific gravities and absorptions of the \naggregates were verified per ASTM C128. Because \nthe procedure of ASTM C128 does not account for \nmaterials with a density less that of water, the team \nconstructed a device that would test the specific \ngravity in a similar fashion. This device included a \nPVC pipe that ran to the bottom of a one-tenth cubic \nfoot bucket, so water can be added during the \nprocess. Also, a PVC pipe ran to the top of the \nbucket as an escape path for any excess air. The \nPVC pipes were affixed to a piece of plexiglas, \nwhich sat on top of the bucket. The only materials \nthat had to be tested in this device were the \nPoraver\u00ae expanded glass spheres. Haydite and \npumice were both dense enough that they did not \nfloat, and therefore were tested using the procedure \noutlined in ASTM C128. Absorptions, by mass, \nwere also calculated for each material and, where \napplicable, were compared to those provided on the \nmaterial technical data sheets. The test results using \nboth test methods are shown in Table 6.  \n Table 6: Tested Aggregate Properties \n* denotes a value verified from the data sheet \n    Due to lack of sufficient ASTM C330 \ndocumentation, which was requested by the 2018 \nRules, pumice was not tested any further. Due to \ncost and lack of significant weight reduction found \nwhen researching other ASTM C330 aggregates, \nHaydite was chosen for use as the ASTM C330 \naggregate in Ascension. This material was readily \navailable locally and was more cost effective than \npumice. Additionally, based on tests performed in \n2017, it creates more strength per volume added \nthan pumice. Poraver\u00ae expanded glass spheres \nwere also tested and used. The sizes used were 0.1-\n0.3 mm, 0.5-1.0 mm, and 1.0-2.0 mm. This \naggregate is manufactured from recycled glass, \nthus making it sustainable. \n      The mix design team completed 12 structural \nmix iterations. The focus of these iterations was to \nincrease the volume of aggregate and test different  \nproportions of cementitious materials. The team \nfound that the relationship between the percentage \nof the mix composed of aggregate and the unit \nweight was a linear relationship, with the higher \npercent aggregate yielding lower unit weights. The \nteam also found that if the volume of Optipozz was \nincreased relative to the other cementitious \nmaterial, unit weight would be decreased with \nminimal strength loss.

The cause \nof the large voids was attributed to two faults of the \nmix design. The first was that the stiffness of the \nstructural mix did not provide good workability, \nand the second was that as the outside of the canoe \nwas troweled, the large sized Haydite was caught \nby the trowel and a void was created. A requirement \nfor the finish mix was that it had to be able to be \nplaced in layers as thin as 1/8 inch. The Pitt \nJohnstown team first used a finish mix in 2010 with \nHess\u2019s Warning (2010) and last used it in 2016 with \nEinstein (2016). The team researched the finish \nmixes used in Hess\u2019s Warning (2010), Phantom \n(2013), and Einstein (2016) to create a baseline.  \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n      \n      \n     The mix design team found that in order to keep \na consistent color between the finish mix and \nstructural mix, the cementitious materials had to be \nkept the same.

Poraver\u00ae 1.0-2.0 \nmm was also removed from the aggregate blend. \nRemoving these aggregates made the mix easier to \nplace in thin layers.  \n     The finish mix was tested for the same \nengineering properties as the structural mix, but its \nrole was purely aesthetic. Therefore, the only \nrequirements for the finish mix were its finishing \ncharacteristics, workability, and compliance with \nthe aggregate proportioning rule.  \n     The mix design team tested a latex modifying \nadmixture and an air entraining admixture. The air \nentraining admixture was tested in an effort to \nlower unit weight; however, this admixture did not \nlower unit weight significantly and created no other \nworkability or strength benefits. The latex modifier \nwas used as it gave the mix a good workability \nwhile maintaining a low slump.

The \nwooden templates were created by making cross-\nsections at 8-inch intervals along the canoe in \nAutodesk Inventor\u00ae Professional 2017. These \nsections were then converted to Autodesk \nAutoCAD\u00ae files so that they could be edited. Once \nthis was completed, a Computer Numerical Control \n(CNC) router was used to accurately cut out the \ntemplates. The use of a CNC router allows the Pitt \nJohnstown team to achieve a level of accuracy close \nto that of a professionally CNC-cut mold without \nthe added cost. \n     The styrofoam pieces were fastened together \nwith four pieces of 6\u2019 long threaded rod. A foam \nspine, originally developed for use in Einstein \n(2016), was used to align the mold for Ascension \nwhen placed on the build table, which would be \nconverted to a curing chamber upon completion of \ncasting. The table was leveled longitudinally and \nlaterally to ensure that Ascension would have no \ntwisting from misalignment. Once on the table, the \nmold was sanded to smooth the seams and create an \neven surface. Joint compound was used to remove \nany imperfections. Finally, the mold was fully \ncoated in 3M\u00ae HVAC tape. This coating replaced \nthe joint compound and oil based paint previously \nused. The 3M\u00ae HVAC tape allowed for cleaner \nform removal and saved many hours of sanding \ncompared to previous years. This mold coating \nultimately had no effect on the budget as it was \nequivalent in cost to the previous coating. \n    On build day, the team was divided into four \ndivisions: mixing, placing, safety, and specialist. \nEach division was divided into teams of 4 people. \nThe chain of command on build day is shown in \nFigure 7. \n     \n \n \n \n   The concrete was placed in 150 batches, each \ncontaining 0.05 cubic feet.

Through these \ncalculations, which will be shown in greater detail in \nAppendix C, it was found that approximately 0.4 cubic \nfeet of foam would be needed, 0.2 cubic feet per \nbulkhead, in order for the canoe to pass the floatation \ntest.

The team \nfelt that the past teams laid a solid foundation for \nsimplistic design elements using coloring, inlays, and \ntextures. However, innovation was lacking in the \ncreative application of these concepts, specifically \nthematic applications; the idea of a metal-textured boat \nrequired a considerably smoother outside finish \ncompared to past canoes. Inlays from past teams also \nleft much to be desired, as they were often messy and \ninconsistent. \nThe team started the design process quickly by \ncreating a small-scale boat, just 3 feet in length, \nnicknamed as and henceforth referred to as BABY \nBOAT. It was created with a parabolic design and a \nsharp tip that poorly resembled a traditional canoe, but \nwould serve as a starting point for mix and aesthetic \ndesign. The mold was created from foam panels that \nwere glued together; however, the glue corroded and \ndeformed the foam, eliminating glue as a viable \ncomponent in the final form"}

A golem\u2019s existence is \noften solely to carry out a task that their creator \ncommands of them. The 2020-21 New York \nUniversity (NYU) Tandon Concrete Canoe Team \ndrew inspiration from these mystical beings to create \nour own \u201cgolem,\u201d in the form of our concrete canoe, \nwhich captures the golem\u2019s spirit and evokes the \nmagic of creation as it comes to life for the \ncompetition.  \n \nFigure 1. Golem Figurine \nNYU Tandon was born in 1854 in Downtown \nBrooklyn. It was originally known as the Brooklyn \nCollegiate and Polytechnic Institute, which served to \nfurther innovations in science and technology for the \nbetterment of society. Through several name changes \nand its 2004 acquisition by New York University, the \ninstitution continues to aspire and achieve more, and \nas a result, NYU Tandon continues to be an active \nparticipant in the Metropolitan Student Conference. \nHistorically, the university has qualified for the \nSociety-wide Final Competition on many occasions. \n2008 Osiris and 2009 Fusion set the tone and early \nstandard, for which the team was among the first to \ndemonstrate and emphasize sustainability with the \nintroduction of recycled glass in concrete.  \nFor the last four consecutive years, excluding \n2020 when the competition was canceled due to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, the team has competed in the \nSociety-wide Concrete Canoe Competition as the \nMetropolitan Conference\u2019s lead representative. \nThese four consecutive qualifications began with \n2016 Koi, which was followed by 2017 Sprout, 2018 \nSpotlight, and 2019 Blue Fin. NYU Tandon\u2019s regular \nparticipation in the National Conference continues to \nmotivate the participating students to incorporate \ndifferent innovations into the project progression. \nThe 2020 Voyager project exemplified this, as the \nteam incorporated robotic 3D printing in concrete \ncanoe"}

Two loading \nconditions were considered: two female paddlers, \nwhich was the lightest possible load, and the four co-\ned paddlers, which was the heaviest possible load.  \nThe resulting draft for the first loading \ncondition was 0.45 ft, while the resulting draft for the \nsecond loading condition was 0.66 ft. According to \nthe generated data for the co-ed load, the canoe \nexperienced more frictional resistance and the \nwaterline height increased. As the total load in the \ncanoe increased, the transverse metacentric height \ndecreased, which indicated that the canoe would be \nless stable with a four-paddler load than with a two-\npaddler load. Furthermore, the prismatic coefficient, \nwhich determines how fast the canoe can accelerate \nto the maximum potential speed and how well it can \nmaintain that speed, increased as the load increased. \nTechnical Approach \nto the overall project \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7 \nThis demonstrated that an increase in load would \nhelp the canoe maintain top speed as opposed to \nslowing it down, shown in Table 4. \nThe hydrostatic data results for the co-ed \nloading conditions for Golem and Voyager were also \ncompare. In comparison to Voyager\u2019s values, \nGolem\u2019s transverse metacentric height and prismatic \ncoefficient values are slightly lower, but its waterline \nheight is slightly higher. The increased volume in the \nwater would help improve the canoe\u2019s stability. The \nvalue of the beam at the waterline was greater than \nthose of previous years, but this is due to the canoe\u2019s \nstability. Despite the increase in wetted surface area, \nthe frictional resistance experienced by Golem is still \nless than that of Voyager.  \nThe \ntheoretical \nmaximum \nspeed \nwas \ncalculated from the average of the top five university \ntimes achieved and the average times achieved by \nNYU paddlers. The theoretical maximum speed for \nthe first load condition was 5.55 knots, while the \ntheoretical maximum speed for the second load \ncondition was 5.98 knots. The maximum possible \nspeed generated by paddlers was 3.00 knots, and this \nwas calculated after considering and factoring in \nenvironmental conditions, the possible waves that \nwould form around the canoe, and the conditions of \nthe paddlers on competition days. By designing the \ncanoe at the theoretical maximum speed of 3.00 \nknots, the canoe would be efficient at such a speed. \nThe speed-length ratio was determined by dividing \nthe maximum possible speed by the square root of \nthe total length of the canoe, and this was calculated \nto be 0.679. The calculated prismatic coefficients for \nboth loading conditions were lower than both the \ncalculated value and the speed-length ratio of 1.257 \nfor the theoretical maximum speed. However, they \nwere still greater than 0.600, which was a priority of \nthe design calculations.  \nThe canoe\u2019s resistance was calculated with \nJohn Winter\u2019s KAPER formula in DELFTship and \nthe specific measurements of each loading condition. \nThe first loading condition had a frictional resistance \nof 2.61 pounds, while the second loading condition \nhad a frictional resistance of 3.28 pounds. Both \nloading conditions resulted in a residual resistance of \n0.02 pounds. Both frictional resistance values were \nlower than those of Voyager, but because frictional \nresistance increases with load, this was expected."}

This extraordinary accomplishment did not come easily. It took \nthe brothers years of experimentation and dedication to achieve their final and most important product. This \nsame determination and experimentation was used in the production of The University of Akron\u2019s 2017 \nconcrete canoe, Wright Way, whose name was chosen as a tribute to the innovations and impact that the \nWright brothers had on both the engineering and scientific communities. \nIn July 1871, the cornerstone of what would later become The University of Akron was placed. While the \nmain building, Buchtel Hall, would burn down in 1899, the foundation of knowledge and support on which the \ncollege was established allowed for the campus to rebuild and grow into what it is today. In 1913, Buchtel \nCollege officially changed its ownership and name to The University of Akron. Since this transformation, the \nuniversity has undergone a dramatic era of growth and prosperity. The College of Engineering was established \nin 1914 and has continued to advance the field of engineering through experimentation and innovation.   \nThe University of Akron, located in Akron, Ohio, \nhas been a member of the Ohio Valley Student \nConference since 2007. The most recent regional \nfinishes were 1st, 4th, and  2nd in 2014, 2015, and \n2016 respectively, and an 11th place finish at the \nnational level in 2014. These past successes have \nprovided Wright Way with a foundation to further \ninnovate and grow, just as the Wright brothers \nexperienced. \nWright \nWay \nhas \nbenefited \nfrom \nseveral  \nenhancements from previous years' concrete \ncanoe teams with the final properties shown in \nTables 1 and 2. Notable improvements include a \n33% reduction in concrete volume, achieved \nthrough a significant increase in flexural strength, \nwhich led to an overall decrease in total wall \nthickness. Two new cementitious materials, VCAS\u2122 and TX Active\u00ae, were introduced to create a more \nenvironmentally-friendly canoe. Continuing the trend of sustainability, the team repurposed a surplus of \nreinforcement and last year\u2019s mold to construct a carbon-fiber practice canoe. This  canoe was utilized in \nweekly training sessions to allow the paddlers to improve their techniques and endurance. \nThis year, the Wright Way team made quality control a priority. Custom hand tools were created to aid in \nconcrete finishing and to create a smooth interior of the canoe. An additional process used to ensure that \nquality standards were upheld was the act of performing compliance checks and calculation reviews \nthroughout the duration of the project.  \nThe team graduated 40% of the members; therefore, to recruit and retain new students, social events were held \non a regular basis throughout the year. The team traveled to the Wright Brothers Exhibit at the National \nMuseum of the United States Air Force to encourage creativity for the canoe\u2019s aesthetic design. Inspired by the \nexhibit, an inlay of an early airplane design was integrated into the canoe\u2019s interior. Team \nleaders implemented new training programs to demonstrate proper safety measures, appropriate use of tools, \nand concrete mixing techniques.

The base model of Zipper II was modified from \nthe Wenonah\u00a9 Minnesota 3 canoe and proved successful in the \nregional competition races. Wright Way continued to build upon \nprevious success by optimizing the design to increase the speed \nwithout sacrificing maneuverability. The relationship between \nthe Minnesota 3 and Wright Way is shown Table 4 (Wenonah, \n2017). \nIn order to effectively compete during races, the canoe needed to have a hull that allowed for both fast straight-\nline tracking and efficient maneuverability around the race buoys. To achieve this balance, Wright Way \nincluded tumblehome gunwales. The inward curvature of the gunwales allows paddlers to have more efficient \nstrokes closer to the center of the canoe. The shallow-arch bottom is a combination of a flat bottom (which \nprovides quick turning) and a round bottom (for straight-line control) and was ideal for the various races. \nThe plumb bow with a fine entry line created a narrow point at the front of the canoe, allowing the canoe to cut \nthrough the water with greater efficiency. Finally, the 2016  hull length was increased by 1 foot while the beam \nwidth was maintained. This increased Wright Way's length-to-beam ratio from 7.4 to 7.7 at \nthe waterline, increasing straight line speed (Moores, 1983).   \nThe hull thickness of Wright Way was reduced by 1/4-inch from \nprevious years to 3/8-inch. Punching shear was accounted for when \ndesigning the mix and reinforcement arrangement. The team set out to \nfind the minimum strength required to resist punching shear failure by \nusing the ultimate shear capacity equation (ACI eq. 22.5.5.1) (ACI \n2014). An assumed 3-inch by 3-inch critical area was used to resemble a \npaddler's knee in contact with the canoe. The dead and live loads used in \nthe punching shear calculation were the assumed weight of the canoe \n(200 pounds) and the largest load case scenario of a male paddler (225 \npounds), respectively. Once the capacity was determined, the required \nconcrete compressive strength could be calculated using ACI eq. \n22.5.5.1. Calculations resulted in a required compressive strength \nof 1,600 psi (Figure 3). \nThrough"}

The \nresultant of 1,600 psi required for the structural mix was exceeded by the Wright Way\u2019s 28-day compressive \nstrength (ASTM C39) of  2,310 psi.   \nTo determine the maximum moment, six loading scenarios were considered (Figure 4). The first case \noccurred when the canoe was subjected to an upward lifting force at the extreme ends when it was removed for \ntransportation. The second scenario involved the canoe being supported one foot from each end by the \nstands. The two-man race was the third case considered, with male paddlers assumed to be 225 pound point \nloads.  The fourth loading scenario investigated the co-ed sprint with two male paddlers and two female \npaddlers, using an assumed 175 pounds point load for the female paddlers. The fifth load case was the two-\nwoman race. By inspection, the lighter load experienced during the women\u2019s races created similar, but \nsmaller  magnitude, resultants to the men\u2019s race load case and was not analyzed further.

This led to WW-2, WW-3, and WW-4 \nusing an improved gradation curve of Haydite 16s, 30s, \nand 50s. WW-4 yielded the highest compressive strength \nof the four mixtures. It was also noted that WW-4 met the \nteam's standards for workability and set time. WW-5 was \nthe same mix as WW-4, except white Portland cement \nwas replaced with TX Active\u00ae as the main binder, \nresulting in an increased compressive strength (Table 5). \nDue to the limited supply of TX Active\u00ae, white Portland \ncement was initially used until the desired compressive strengths were achieved. Air entrainer was tested in \nWW-5A in an attempt to reduce unit density; however, results were less than satisfactory.  \nTo account for tensile loads being applied during the races, \nthe team performed a split tension test following ASTM \nC496 (Figure 7). It was calculated that the tensile strength of \nthis year\u2019s mix was 220 psi, compared to 113 psi in the \nprevious year. The team also tested Wright Way's final mix to \ndetermine its elastic modulus using a 6-inch by 12-inch \ncylinder loaded in a compressometer machine according to \nASTM C496. The results of this test were used to produce a \nstress-strain curve that determined the elastic modulus of \nWright Way to be 1300 ksi, compared to last year's 964 ksi. \nProducing a canoe weighing under 200 pounds was a major \npriority for the team. This was achieved by reducing the total amount of material in the canoe through \ndecreasing the total layer thickness. In order to decrease the hull thickness an equivalent flexural strength \nneeded to be developed during third-point bending (ASTM C78). \nAkron's three previous canoes contained carbon-fiber mesh as the primary reinforcement, but suffered from \npoor bonding and subsequent delamination between the concrete layers.

After thorough \ninvestigation, the team pursued a 10-millimeters by 10-\nmillimeters basalt geogrid. To ensure that the material \nappropriately bonded, slab tests were conducted in flexural \nloading under third point bending .  \nConcrete slabs, with dimensions of 15-inches by 4-inches \nby 3/8-inch, were heat cured for 7-days to mimic the  \ncanoe\u2019s condition at 28 days. Initial tests confirmed that \nthe newer material improved bonding between layers. \nThese resulting failures, however; were brittle and showed \nunfavorable strengths. The configurations used for these \ninitial tests can be seen in slabs 1 through 3 in Figure 8. \nResults revealed strengths of 312 psi, 420 psi, and 324 psi \nrespectively.  \nThrough further research, the team integrated a steel cable \nto better distribute the load. The additional reinforcement \nsignificantly increased flexural strength and caused the \nslabs to bend instead of break at the point loads (Figure 9). \nAlthough slab 5 broke at 1,404 psi, 240 psi greater than \nslab 4, configuration 4 was selected for better bonding and \nease of placement. With the mix finalized and \nreinforcement scheme selected, the team was able to \nconfidently move forward with the preparation for Pour \nDay activities. \nPrior to Pour Day, all the mix components were pre-measured to streamline \nproduction and improve mix quality (Figure 10).

The room was rearranged to accommodate greater occupancy and tripping hazards were eliminated \nby taping all extension cords at the base of the wall. Before batching began, the SCO refreshed everyone on \nthe proper use and disposal of PPE. \nAll team members were then assigned a task consisting of either batching, quality control, reinforcement \npreparation, or placement. The team decided to cut the secondary reinforcement on Pour Day. The basalt \ngeogrid is a loosely woven fabric, which easily gets tangled and deforms from its original shape. To increase \nease of placement and reduce the risk of damage, the reinforcement was cut directly off the roll and placed in \nthe canoe. \nDuring placement, the \u201cchase method\u201d was utilized to reduce the risk of delamination between layers. For the \nfirst layer, concrete was placed in the first five feet of the canoe. The steel cables were then laid at their \napproximate location before covering them with basalt geogrid. The \nsecond layer of concrete was then packed on top while the first layer \ncontinued to be placed. This process was used throughout casting. When \nthe team approached the center of the canoe, the inlay was placed on top \nof the basalt reinforcement and concrete was packed around it. \nThe 2017 team built two tools to help with placement; the first resembling \na float and the second resembling a trowel. The handmade tools were \ndesigned with a rounded surface to transition in curvatures of the canoe \nand smooth the concrete. The following day, the linoleum inlay was \nremoved from the center of the canoe and filled with the charcoal gray \naesthetics mix (Figure 13).  \nThe canoe was enclosed in a humidity tent that the team built in 2015. A \nspace heater and four ultrasonic humidifiers were placed on the inside of \nthe tent and left on high for the first week. To prevent dry shrinkage \ncracking, the humidity was gradually lowered beginning at 14 days for the \nremainder of the curing process. The 7-day compressive results showed \nadequate early strength, which allowed the schedule to be pushed forward. \nCuring took place for only 21 days instead of the original plan for 28 \ndays.  The removal of the mold and wet sanding took place while the \ncanoe was still being exposed to humidity. Disassembly began by \nremoving the top rail form, followed by each foam sheet (Figure 14). To \ncorrect an inconsistencies that occurred during placement, 40- grit sand \npaper was used to wet sand the interior of the canoe. \nAfter the full 21 days, the end caps were completed.

The entire \ncanoe was then dry sanded with 60-, 120-, 220-, 400-, and 800-grit \nsandpaper.

Managers across the \nproject \ncorresponded \nwith \nproject \nmanagers \nconsistently via Microsoft Teams and frequent \nmanager meetings to discuss progress and innovative \nideas. Knowledge was transferred from managers to \ngeneral members through in-depth tutorials of each \ndiscipline. This, in addition to the practice cast of the \ncanoe, provided sufficient experience for the team to \nconstruct the final prototype. \nAfter quality parameters were set, quality \ncontrol measures were taken to fulfill quality \nrequirements during the final casting day [33]. \nQuality control measures included quality managers \nconfirming all concrete materials were measured to \none-hundredth place precision and final consistency \nwas inspected, particularly for potential fiber \nclumps.

Nonetheless, modifications were made using \nOrca3D\u00ae, a watercraft conception software, in order \nto improve the baseline model. \nA major concern about the races was water \nentering the canoe, especially during the co-ed sprint. \nWaves generated by other canoes could potentially \npass over the canoe\u2019s freeboard, therefore increasing \nsignificantly its total weight and drag for the rest of \nthe race. In order to improve the performance of the \ncanoe in agitated water, the bow was raised by 2 in. \nSince this change increased the canoe\u2019s weight, the \nchoice was made to lower the stern by 1 in. This \nmethod was preferred to adding bulkhead, to avoid \nexcessive weight gain. \nRockers and chines remained unchanged from \nBluenose V (2015). The height difference between the \nbow and stern rockers moved the floating center \nbackward, helping maneuverability. Low rockers \nprovided a good straight line speed by helping the \nbow to rip through the water. The progressive \nwidening of the shape was also selected to improve \nthis.

Strength-strain relationships for the \nmaterials (Appendix 2.2.1) show that carbon fiber and steel have the greatest stiffness, and carbon fiber \nand Kevlar\u00ae are the strongest. Steel was not considered because of its low specific strength [stress/density] \nand Kevlar\u00ae was eliminated because of its low stiffness and high cost. The selected materials were carbon \nfiber mesh, which offered the optimum mechanical properties, and fiberglass scrim, which offered \nintermediate properties but was readily available.  \nStress distribution: Before selecting a final reinforcing scheme, we needed to determine the forces in the \ncanoe during the critical load cases.

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant that writes proposals for the ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "prompt": "Write the development and testing section for an ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "output": ": To verify the strengths of the carbon fiber and fiberglass, we performed tension tests. A single \ncarbon fiber was tested in tension and failed at 734 N (165 lb), which is consistent with the nominal \nstrength. The tension test of a 127 mm (5 in) wide strip of the fiberglass scrim (consisting of 14 double \nfibers) using a standard grab test failed at 1135 N (255 lb). The fiberglass scrim, failed at a higher load \nthan expected, because during the test, the scrim became distorted and the horizontal fibers were able to \ntake some of the load.  \nSince all the reinforcements considered were either a mesh or a scrim, we had to devise a way to fit \nthe two-dimensional reinforcement on the three-dimensional canoe. This problem was solved for the \ncarbon fiber mesh by using a 2x2 Twill weave, which drapes easily over three-dimensional surfaces. The \nfiberglass scrim was more challenging because it does not drape well due to the chemical bonding of the \nfibers. The best way to fit the scrim was to place it on the canoe and make transverse cuts where required. \nHowever, it had to be decided whether to overlap or cut and tie the scrim at the cuts. To study the \ndifference, we cast two 0.61 m x 0.3 m (2 ft x 1 ft) test plates, one with the scrim tied and the other with \nthe scrim lapped. The test results showed that overlapping the pieces is a superior technique because the \nplates failed at 178 N (40 lb) versus the 44 N (10 lb) fracture strength exhibited by the tied reinforcement.  \nBefore selecting the final reinforcement configuration for the canoe, we had to investigate the \ncomposite action that each scheme has with our concrete mixes.  \nUC Berkeley \n- 5 - \n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0001\u0002\u0004\u0005\u0002\u0006 \nComposite Action \nGoals \n Minimize cracking. \n Resist critical loads without delaminating. \nImplementation \nOnce the two concrete mixes were determined, we needed to test the interaction of the two mixes \nwith the two reinforcement schemes we had developed. The first set of tests were three-point tests of 0.3 \nm x 0.3 m (1 ft x 1 ft) plates to test flexural capacity. The plates with the fiberglass/carbon fiber \ncombination failed at 735 N (165 lb) and the plates reinforced with the carbon mesh failed at 665 N (150 \nlb). These tests showed that either option produced a similar flexural capacity. All test plates failed in the \nmanner anticipated by the structural design team: the inside layer started cracking first; at high loads and \nafter significant deflections a dominant crack formed in the strong outer layer and the plates failed.  \nFor the reinforcement to work effectively with the two concrete mixes, delamination had to be \nconsidered. We performed pullout tests, using the equipment for a standard grab test, on the \nreinforcement embedded in 0.51 m x 0.13 m (20 in x 5 in) test plates. All plates delaminated severely, and \nthis was found to be due largely to the graphite coating on the carbon fibers (Appendix 2.3.1). We \neliminated this problem by sanding the surface of the carbon fibers before casting new test plates. \nSanding the fibers proved beneficial since the carbon fibers formed a strong bond with the concrete mix. \nWe then performed a three-point test on test plates containing the sanded carbon fibers. These plates were \nable to withstand the load even after the dominant crack had formed due to the increased bonding.  \nThe fiberglass/carbon fiber combination was selected because it allowed the flexibility to better \nreinforce locations of higher stress concentrations by decreasing the spacing of the carbon fibers. The \ncomposite design provides a negative moment capacity of 1627 N-m (1200 lb-ft) (Safety Factor of 2), \nand a positive moment capacity of 6915 N-m (5100 lb-ft) (Safety Factor of 7)."}

The straight-aways require the speed \nof a sprint canoe; yet the slalom course and \nbuoy turns require the maneuverability of a \nwhitewater canoe.  After examining last year\u2019s \ncanoe, Main Course, and its results in each race, \n3CT determined that there was not one optimum \ndesign for a canoe but rather many good designs \ntailored to the strengths of the paddlers. \n     3CT\u2019s first step in developing a new hull \ndesign for Cast Away was to gather input \nfrom last year\u2019s paddlers regarding which hull \ncharacteristics were most important.  The team \ndetermined speed and maneuverability to be \nmost important due to the different requirements \nof the races.  However, these goals could \nnot be obtained if the paddlers were not able \nto perform in an efficient manner.  Last \nyear\u2019s paddlers suffered in the four person \nrace when the middle two people were not \nable to easily reach the water for efficient \nstrokes.  Therefore, 3CT decided the beam \nand freeboard needed to be reduced, while \nthe stability needed to be increased from last \nyear\u2019s canoe.  For the team to maintain the \nspeed of previous canoes, the drag on the \ncanoe needed to be reduced.  The paddlers \nalso expressed concern about stability and \nthe lack of sufficient stability in rough water \ncould be disastrous for this year\u2019s team.

The target values for the concrete \nmix and composite section were established \nafter determining the most severe loading \nconditions that Cast Away will undergo and \nthe stress caused by these loadings. \n     A concrete canoe undergoes two types of \nloading conditions, a static condition and a \ndynamic condition.  Each of these conditions \ncauses different stresses on the canoe.  Under a \nstatic condition, the canoe is sitting in the water \nand the paddlers are in position.  3CT used a \nspreadsheet structural model to determine the \nmaximum shear and moment the canoe will \nundergo during this condition.  The paddlers \nwere treated as 180 lb (68.04 kg) loads and each \npaddler was assumed to be three feet from their \nrespective end of the canoe for the static \ncondition.  Each paddler was assumed to be a \npoint load.  The self weight of the canoe and the \nbuoyancy of the water along the length of the \ncanoe were calculated at one inch intervals and \nused in the structural model.  The structural \nspreadsheet allowed the team to determine the \nmaximum moment to be 694.3 ft-lbs (941.3 N-\nm) and a maximum shear of 166.7 lbs (741.5 N) \nwhen only two paddlers were in the canoe.  The \nvalues were used as design loads in the concrete \ndesign program CONCAD.  When using the \nprogram the thickness of the canoe was \nconsidered to be 0.4 in. (10.16 mm) with each \nlayer of concrete being 0.0625 in. (1.59 mm) \nthick based on constructability considerations.  \nThe team used an iterative process of increasing \nthe minimum strength of the concrete until the \nmaximum moment would not cause failure in \nthe canoe.  This process yielded a concrete with \na minimum compressive strength of 1000 psi \n(6.89 MPa), prior experience compelled the \nteam to use a minimum flexural strength of 400 \npsi (2.76 MPa).   \n     Next, the dynamic loading conditions the \ncanoe will undergo were examined.

In each phase of concrete research, the \nteam utilized standard tests.  Compressive \nstrength was measured with 2 inch (50.8 mm) \ncubes in accordance to ASTM C109.  Flexural \nstrength was determined according to ASTM C \n78 by applying a load at the third points of an 8 \nin. (203.2 mm) long, 1.25 in (31.8 mm) wide, \nand 2 in. (50.8 mm) deep beam.  Shrinkage was \nevaluated based on ASTM C157 by measuring \nthe shrinkage strains of unrestrained prisms over \na period of 28 days.  Workability was assessed \nqualitatively while usability was measured in \nminutes.   \n     Phase one began by determining the \noptimum blend of glass bubbles for a \nlightweight concrete mix.  Although, 3CT has \nused glass bubbles in previous years, the team \nwanted a new combination that would permit a \nlower unit weight.  Since unit weight and \nstrength are correlated, the team had to \ndetermine a suitable tradeoff between strength \nand unit weight.  After \nevaluating over 40 different \nblends involving 6 types of \nglass bubbles with varying \nspecific gravity (SG), size, \nand crush strength, the team \nchose a combination of K25 \nbubbles (SG=.25) and S32 \n(SG=.32) bubbles.  The base \nmix had unit weight of 59.5 \nlbs/ft^3 (845.1 kg/m^3) and compressive strength \nof 1664 psi (11.5 MPa) and a flexural strength of \n311 psi (2.14 MPa).  This base mix was used as \nthe control for all of the remaining tests. \n     Next, two types of fly ash were tested. \nMixtures containing class C and class F fly ash \nwere tested at 28 days.  The team selected the \nclass C fly ash for its light gray color since there \nwas no substantial difference in compressive or \nflexural strength and workability was constant \nbetween the two types of fly ash.   \n     Phase two involved evaluating the effects of \npolymer based binders.  Each latex was tested for \nits effect on compressive and flexural strength, \nusability, workability, and unit weight.  All three \nlatexes tested reduced the compressive strength of \nthe base mix, but the increase in flexural strength \noff-set this slight reduction.  While all three \nlatexes increased workability drastically; L2 had \na much shorter pot life than L1 and L3.  Using the \nweighted scoring table below (Table 1), the team \nselected L1 because of its increase of 262.8% in \nflexural strength, and its reduction of unit weight \nby 17.1% over the base mix. \n     Phase three of the concrete research included \nthe selection of fibers and admixtures for the mix.  \n3CT evaluated four polypropylene fibers and \nchopped carbon fibers.  The fibers were used to \nincrease the flexural strength of the mix by \nbridging micro-cracks and redistributing internal \nstrains in the concrete.  During"}

First the team \nobtained \nliterature \nfrom \nmanufacturers \nregarding each type of reinforcement.  This \neliminated the carbon fiber mesh because the \npotential gain in strength did not off set the high \ncost when compared to the polypropylene mesh.  \nNext, each mesh was tested for in plane bending \nusing ASTM C293 on specimens 0.4 in.

In the end, our 2001 \nentry, Obi-Wan Canoebi, was deemed the one that \nwould be used for Ghetto Fabulous.    \nAt 6.3 m (20.8 ft.), Ghetto Fabulous \nincorporates a length that falls within the range \nproven by past national champions (Wisconsin, \n2002; UAH, 2001; Clemson, 2000;) to provide \nsuperior speed and maneuverability for the current \nrace configurations.  The theoretical hull speed, \nempirically based on the length of the vessel at the \nwaterline, is estimated to be 3.20 m/sec or 10.40 \nft/sec (Gillmer and Johnson, 1982).  The hull \nmaintains a sharp bow at the entry line and a \nnarrow maximum beam width.  From the bow \nback, the canoe widens slowly and smoothly until \nit reaches it fullness of 78.8 cm (31 in) just aft of \namidships.  This is typical of most sophisticated \nracing hulls that have their fullness shifted to the \nrear resulting in an efficient design that balances \nspeed, capacity and stability (Jensen, 1993a).  \nThe \nbeam-to-length \nratio \nof \n0.11-to-1 \ncorresponds to a canoe that has an increase in both \nspeed and tracking with only a slight reduction in \nits stability and maneuverability. By designing a \nlong asymmetrical hull, the canoe tracks straighter \nand travels faster with greater ease, glides farther \nbetween strokes, and can carry more weight with \nminimal loss of performance (Jensen, 1993b).   \nThe shallow arch cross-section used in Ghetto \nFabulous provides a high resistance to capsizing.  \nWith a surface-to-volume ratio designed to \ndecrease the wetted surface area, the resulting \nskin friction that is the primary contributor to \nresistance at paddling speeds is ultimately reduced \n(Gillmer and Johnson, 1982).    The shallow arch \ntapers into a \u201cwhale tail\u201d in the stern to further \nenhance the tracking ability of the canoe.  The \nflared-out sidewalls of the whale tail allow the \nstern paddler to sit further back in the canoe \nallowing better handling and control.  The shallow \narch section combines the best attributes of a flat \nbottomed-cross section - maneuverability and \nstability - with the speed and tracking associated \nwith a circular section.   \nTo increase the maneuverability of the canoe, \n7.6 cm (3 in.) of bow rocker and 3.8 cm (1.5 in.) \nof stern rocker was used.  The slight amount of \nrocker does result in a small decrease in tracking \nand speed, but it is essential in the quick \nnegotiation of the slalom and turning buoys.  The \ncenter depth of 30.5 cm (13 in.) provides \nsufficient freeboard during the 4-person co-ed \nsprint race.  The gunwale beam is narrow enough \nto allow efficient paddling, but wide enough for \npaddler ergonomics.  In addition, the shear line \nslopes up from the center of the canoe to the bow \nto prevent water from overtopping the canoe.  \nFigure 4 provides plan, side, and cross sectional \nviews of Ghetto Fabulous. \nThe only modifications made in relation to the \n2001 version of the canoe, include the installation \nof flotation tanks in the bow and stern section and \nthe elimination of the thickened gunwale and \nthwarts.

STARS \ntechnology (Gilbert et al. 2001; Ooi et al. 2003a, 2003b; Marotta et al. 2004) has captured the attention \nof the U.S. Congress, NASA, and the DoD. Our faculty has secured extramural funding to build \nfacilities and exploit the underlying strategy. A STARS class (STARS 2004) was offered at UAH during \nthe spring semester and the U.S. Army is currently soliciting proposals in this area as part of their Small \nBusiness Innovative Research (SBIR) \nprogram. \nWe designed our canoe so that the \nnatural frequencies of its cementitious \ncomposite hull are excited by the \nforcing \nfunction \ncreated \nby \nour \npaddlers. As our boat is driven toward \ncontrolled resonance, the flexible hull \ndeforms due to the torsional and \nbending moments applied, and very large stresses and strains are generated. Our composites are \ndesigned to keep all of the materials elastic so that the structure is absolutely resilient, thus enabling the \nstrain energy stored in the deformed shape to be completely recovered. As we pull our paddles from the \nwater, this energy is converted into forward momentum, thereby forcing our boat to surge forward and \nswim (see Fig. 1; ConcreteCanoe.org 2004).  \nBoats of similar shape and weight are not equally efficient because their dynamic response and \nmodal parameters depend on the density, stiffness, and position of the materials employed during \nfabrication, as well as the physical constraints imposed by structural members and boundary conditions \nencountered while racing. Last year, for example, we produced a concrete canoe that provided a 12% \nincrease in speed over the speeds recorded by the same teams in a fiberglass prototype that had the same \ndimensions and weight. In addition to being made from different materials, the prototype included \nthwarts and had a totally different modal response. \nConQuest might look deceptively similar to those canoes fielded by other contenders, but due \nto its unique dynamic properties, it is miles ahead in performance."}

The national competitors have studied these problems using \nnumerical techniques (Design Reports 2003), but none of their models take the dynamic characteristics \nof the canoe into consideration and, for all intents and purposes, are not as scientific as ours. To our \nknowledge, we are the only school that has measured the service loads while paddling (Team UAH \n2002) and the only team with a finite element model powerful enough to predict and verify their canoe\u2019s \ndynamic performance (Ooi et al. 2003a). \nWe mounted strain gages on a prototype concrete canoe and found that the peak strain occurs \ndirectly beneath the paddlers. We modeled these critical sections by pure bending and loaded a test \nplate, having a cross section identical to that used in the prototype concrete canoe, until the critical strain \nwas reached. We determined that the threshold strain for the critical loading (when four paddlers \nparticipate in the co-ed sprint) is equivalent to a 2.6 N-m (23 in-lb) moment applied to a 2.54 cm (1 \nin.) wide plate.  \nBenchmark Selection: Our structural design relies on the large difference in stiffness between \nthe constituents in a 0.76 cm (0.3 in.) thick composite section to drive the internal stress from a flexible \ncementitious matrix to three layers of a relatively stiff graphite mesh having an elastic modulus of \n231GPa (33.5 Msi).

The graphite has a high tensile strength [3.65 GPa (530 ksi)] and, with a safety \nfactor over fifteen, there is little chance that the fibers will break.

While designing a concrete canoe, for example, \nthe structure cannot be allowed to crack and knowledge of the concrete compressive strength is not as \nimportant as it is in other applications. It is the modulus of elasticity and tensile strength of the \ncementitious matrix, as well as the bond strength between the matrix and the reinforcement, that \nimpact the design most. For a given geometrical configuration, the stiffness ratio of the reinforcement \nto the matrix controls the stress transfer and governs the fundamental frequencies and amplitudes of the \nmode shapes. \nReinforcement Compliance: We introduced graphite fibers in 1993 (Team UAH 1993) and used \nthem again this year because they are ten times stronger and five times lighter than steel. As mentioned \npreviously, a dynamic finite element model (Ooi et al. 2003a, 2003b) was used to locate and orient our \nreinforcement in a 0.76 cm (0.3 in.) thick composite section. Each layer consists of a non-impregnated \ngraphite mesh with 3,000 fibers per tow, spaced at 3.18 mm (0.125 in.) intervals; and, each tow is 0.19 \nmm (0.0075  in.) thick by 1.07 mm (0.042  in.) wide. According to the manufacturer, the elastic modulus \nand tensile strength of the graphite fiber are 231GPa (33.5 Msi) and 3.65 GPa (530 ksi), respectively. \nWe used three graphite layers and have already described our lay-up in the fifth paragraph on page 2. \nWe tested this configuration for compliance as outlined in Section II.B.5.b (NCCC Rules 2004) and it \npassed all tests. We also performed reinforcement thickness measurements in accordance with Section \nII.B.5.c (NCCC Rules 2004) and computed a maximum reinforcement/thickness ratio of only 0.18. The \ntest procedures and results are included in our Engineer\u2019s Notebook (Team UAH 2004). \nMix Design: Although last year\u2019s mix (Team UAH 2003) did not meet this year\u2019s rules, we \nselected it as a benchmark. We placed the mix over our reinforcement scheme and loaded a control \nspecimen [10.2 cm (4 in.) wide by 30.5 cm (12 in.) long] to failure by subjecting it to pure bending \n(ASTM 2002a). The control specimen sustained a maximum moment of 22.6 N-m (200 in-lb), \nequivalent to a 5.65 N-m (50 in-lb) moment applied to a 2.54 cm (1 in.) wide plate, over twice the \nrequired service load. \nWe envisioned designing a new concrete mix with the same elastic modulus as our benchmark that \ncould be used to fabricate a plate that had higher strength and was more water resistant than the control \nspecimen. The concrete mix had to be strong enough in tension so that it met our maximum stress \ncriteria, but we recognized that this did not necessarily mean that the composite section would resist the \nmaximum service load. Bond strength in the matrix is very important and the composition and crush \nstrength of the aggregates must be carefully selected to control the failure modes. \nThe final mix was designed and selected based on a method developed for fabricating \nstructurally equivalent cementitious STARS (Raut et al. 2004). We varied the constituents in our \nbenchmark mix and tested composite plates, as described above, until we matched the deflection of our \ncontrol specimen. Since the new mix and the benchmark mix were placed over identical reinforcement \nschemes, they both have the same elastic modulus. The procedure allows designers to perform concrete \nmix design while studying, concurrently, the impact that changes in constituents have on the overall \nstructural performance of their composite(s). \nBenchmark Properties:  Last year\u2019s mix had a unit weight of 848 kg/m3 (52.9 lb/ft3); binders \nwere Portland cement [211.6 kg/m3 (13.2 lb/ft3)], latex [21.6 kg/m3 (1.3 lb/ft3)] and fly ash [60.4 kg/m3 \n(3.8 lb/ft3)].

Last year we varied the percentage of fly \nash (conforming to ASTM 2003c) in our mix and found that the highest tensile strength was achieved \nwhen it was added at 10% by weight of the binding materials. Changes in this year\u2019s rules forced us to \nincrease this to 15%. Latex is a key ingredient that enhances the bonding and flexibility of our \ncementitious matrix. Unfortunately, it disassociates if placed in water too long. Although the acrylic \nfortifier makes the mix more water resistant, it significantly reduces flexibility. When we included the \nsolid portions of the latex and acrylic fortifier in a 2:1 ratio, we produced a sufficiently flexible mix that \nwas much more water-resistant than our benchmark concrete mix. \nAggregate Selection: Section II.B.2 (NCCC Rules 2004) stipulates that we are required to add \nsand (ASTM 2003a) as a fine aggregate. We added only slightly more sand than the minimum required \nbecause sand adds undesired weight; its non-uniform sizes and varying shapes make it difficult for us to \ncontrol the failure mode and quantify the bond strength of the composite. We offset these detriments by \nadding two different types of lightweight and uniformly sized micro-spheres (K-1 and K-15 brands from \n3M) to the mix.  We added as many of these constituents as we could and blended them to create the \nstrongest and lightest mix possible. \nAdmixture: The new rule restricting the water-cementitious materials ratio to a maximum of 0.5 \n(II.B.1.e; NCCC 2004) posed our greatest challenge. The additional fly ash included in the binders \nhelped to reduce this ratio, but we were forced to consider alternatives such as adding superplasticizer \nand water reducer. The addition of these ingredients provided the required ratio, but mixes placed with \nsuperplasticizer were very brittle and cracks occurred during the curing process, forcing us to discard \nthem. The water reducer, on the other hand, provided workability without significantly reducing the \ntensile strength or compromising the elasticity of the matrix. The aggregates were brought to the \nsaturated surface dry condition, so that none of the water needed to hydrate the cementitious materials \nwould be used to hydrate the aggregates (ASTM 2003e). We also investigated the process of air \nentrainment to reduce weight, but this produced anomalies and voids in the cementitious matrix that \ncould not be predicted or controlled."}

Rockers also add \nmaneuverability by \nlifting the bow and \nstern out of the water, \ncreating a pivot point at \nthe midship. \n     Length is a large \nfactor affecting \nmaneuverability.  Long \ncanoes are generally \nfaster than shorter \ncanoes, but are harder \nto turn.  A length of 19'-\n0\" was chosen in order \nto adequately seat four \npaddlers and enable \nquick turning.   \n     Maneuverable canoes tend to have \ntracking problems. This becomes less of an issue \nwith experienced paddlers.   \n \nStability \nA flat bottom hull generally rides higher in the \nwater, causing it to be unstable (Moores 2000).  A \nrounded transition between the flat bottom and \nthe sidewall counteracts the instability while \nmaintaining the benefits of maneuverability.  A \nwidth of 32\" was also selected to ensure adequate \nstability.  Additionally, a tumblehome will \nincrease paddler efficiency and stability by \nreducing a paddler\u2019s reach and excessive leaning. \n     The depth of the canoe was determined from a \nwater displacement calculation.  A 7\" freeboard in \nthe four-person race is needed to ensure the canoe \nwill not sink.  A 13\" depth was selected to satisfy \nthis requirement. \n \nSpeed \nDifferent hull geometries and dimensions were \nstudied for speed.  A canoe\u2019s speed is dependent \non the total drag force (TDF) the water exerts on \nthe hull  (Lasauskas, Tuck, and Winters 1997). \nTDF = viscous resistance + wave resistance. \nThese resistances can be quantified with a flow"}

Of the 33,000 students enrolled at this flagship school of the UC system, the \nCivil and Environmental Engineering Department prepares close to 250 undergraduates for leadership \nin the professional activities of civil engineering.

To maintain a straight path with low tracking, the \nrear paddler spends much of her time performing turning stokes, thus reducing speed. \nThe problem is that paddlers repeatedly exert a net torque on the canoe. One solution is \nto reduce the current 6.1 in. rise in the canoe\u2019s bottom profile from its center to its ends, \nthereby reducing its rocker (See Design Drawings). While this improves tracking by \nincreasing the resistance to torque from the water, it is detrimental to the canoe\u2019s \nmaneuverability, defined here as the ability to turn (CanoeRoots, 2003). A better option \nis ComiCal\u2019s symmetry about the transverse centerline, the canoe\u2019s mid-ship. In \ncontrast, asymmetrical designs put the center of gravity closer to the stern, requiring the \nrear paddler to steer more. Thus the symmetrical design was retained, where paddlers \nexert equal forces and, correspondingly, equal and opposite torque, requiring fewer \nturning strokes (Figure 1). In an attempt to improve tracking even further, increasing \nlength was modeled, but maneuverability, constructability, transportation, and weight \nbecame critical concerns. As such, the designers limited the length to 22 feet.  \n \nComiCal has a relatively flat-bottom hull; this is disadvantageous for speed since increasing the wetted \nsurface area increases frictional drag. This resistance is most significant when the canoe is moving \nslowly: when races begin and while negotiating buoys (Lazauskas & Tuck, 1996). However, the critical \nfactor in this part of the design is stability. In design software, initial stability is measured by a canoe\u2019s \nreaction, or inherent \u201cRighting Arm,\u201d to each increment of rotation \nabout the canoe\u2019s longitudinal axis. This is the distance between the \ncenter of gravity of the canoe and the center of the reacting buoyancy \nforce (Papoulias, 2002). Since paddlers routinely fell out of Bearrier \nReef (2001) during turns, Bearied Treasure\u2019s initial stability ought to \nbe greater. Since all attempts at rounding the bottom of the canoe and \ndecreasing its maximum beam, or width, resulted in dangerously low \nstability (Figure 2), the cross-section and maximum beam of 29.3 \nin. were not modified for Bearied Treasure. \n \nAnother consideration is ultimate stability, which is the maximum angle the canoe can rotate about its \nlongitudinal axis without water entering (Papoulias, 2002). This is influenced mostly by freeboard, the \nheight of the canoe above the water. It is advantageous to decrease freeboard because it directly \ninfluences the weight of the canoe. At the 2004 Mid-Pac, ComiCal\u2019s freeboard was just enough to \nprevent taking on water. Therefore, its ultimate stability was set as the minimum standard for Bearied \nTreasure with a minimum freeboard of 7.0 in. and maximum depth of 13.5 in.  \n \nThis design team found that all changes to the"}

These were checked \nwith hand calculations. Finally, capacities of frame elements were found using XTRACT. \n \nIn the initial XTRACT models, preliminary composite values obtained from the Concrete Engineer \nwere implemented. The concrete had an elastic modulus of 1450 ksi and ultimate compressive strength \nof 2.8 ksi. The reinforcement consisted of circular strands with area of 0.0005 sq. in., an elastic \nmodulus of 11300 ksi and ultimate tensile strength of 270 ksi. \n \nThe canoe was first modeled by hand as a beam with a 200 lb. distributed self-weight in many \nscenarios. The two critical cases were (1) constant hydrostatic pressure and four paddlers, with a \nmaximum positive moment demand of 6.6 kip-in.; (2) linear triangular hydrostatic pressure distribution \nand two paddlers, with a maximum negative moment demand of 7.1 kip-in. XTRACT revealed the \nmoment capacity of the canoe at its yield point to be \u00b1 65 kip-in., far exceeding demand in all \nscenarios. \n \nSAP models were created to determine demands on shell and frame elements. Using a mesh of 1792 \nshell elements, loading scenarios were paddling, transportation (via the trailer and via people), on \nstands, and submersion. Paddler loads were modeled as uniform and non-uniform. The controlling \nloading case was identified as four paddlers exerting 60% of their 180 lb. loads on their feet. The \npaddler-loading configuration that yielded the highest demands consisted of four-point loads (knees & \nshins) and uniform shell loads (feet). After recursively determining the conditions for equilibrium of the \nmodel without restraint (floating), the hydrostatic pressure was confirmed.  \n \nUsing the SAP design loading case, three critical tensile stress locations were identified in the shell: the \narea beneath the paddlers, the area of high curvature between the sides and bottom, and the top at the \nmid-ship. Without a frame, the shell distributes its longitudinal tensile stresses to the aforementioned \ncritical locations; tensile stresses at the top edge reach 1000 psi. To disrupt this distribution pattern, a \nframe system was researched (Kassegne & Reddy, 1997). After much iteration, the best configuration \nconsisted of three ribs and a gunwale. \n \nA gunwale is a frame element that circumscribes the top of the shell. Its design was based on an FEA \nmodel assumption that it is attached to the shell at its nodes, creating continuous moment releases \n(Kassegne & Reddy, 1997). In SAP, the gunwale\u2019s only demand is 84 lb. in axial tension. It has an \nadequate axial tension capacity of 270 lb., according to XTRACT. \n \nRibs are transverse frame elements. As modeled, ribs are attached to the shell at their nodes. The \noptimal number of ribs is three: one at the mid-ship and two 61 in. aft and bow of the mid-ship. \nAccording to SAP, the maximum demands on the ribs are a positive moment of 230 lb-in. and 50 lb. of \naxial tension.  According to XTRACT, their capacities are 330 lb-in of positive moment and 700 lb. of \naxial tension. \n \nSAP revealed that decreasing the shell thickness by \u215b in. doubles the tensile demand, validating \u215c in. \nas the minimum thickness. With a frame and \u215c in. thick shell, the composite in SAP yields maximum \ntensile stress demand of 400 psi and maximum compressive stress demand of 340 psi. These demand \nstresses were checked using hand calculations at critical locations; these values were comparable to \nvalues found in SAP. Thus, the SAP"}

As a result, 1 1/4in. tall by 1/2in. wide \nribs were situated across the bottom of the \ncanoe and through the chine to effectively \nreduce cracking in these locations. \n Architectural features were created to enhance \nthe appearance and to reduce the weight of \nTaliesin. It was revealed from FEA that stresses \ndecreased considerably from the chine toward \nthe gunwales. Rib designs were modified to \ncomplement the stresses induced onto the hull.  \nAs a result, the ribs were tapered from the chine \nto the gunwales.  This innovative design \nprovided structural support, reduced weight, \nand added a sophisticated  architectural feature \nto Taliesin. \n Another architectural component that also \nreduced weight was the newly implemented \nvariable wall thickness (VWT). Low stresses in \nthe walls allowed engineers to reduce hull \nthickness to 3/8in. in specified locations without \ncompromising structural integrity.  The VWT \nwas strategically placed to utilize the pre-stress \nwires for support and was designed to follow \nlinear principles of Frank Lloyd Wright.

We secured the steel \nbridge alongside the coffin in the approximate location of the failure, which happens to be above the \naxle. \nWhile pulling out of the parking lot, Dr. Martin (our faculty advisor), hit a tree on the broadside \nof the trailer while performing a sharp turn.  This caused the trailer to rise on one side, inducing a \ntorsional force along the longitudinal axis of the trailer.  This torsion caused the tie downs to come loose \nenough to allow the blocking to slide from underneath the coffin, and the coffin than became loose.  \nWhen the trailer came back down, the resulting force was too much to be taken up by the suspension \nsystem as would be the case when hitting a pothole.  This force transmitted up into the coffin, causing \nthe canoe to shift inside and break. \nAfter hitting the tree, we opened the trailer and coffin to discover that the coffin had shifted and \nthe canoe broke at the location of the failure in a manner consistent with being compressed transversely \nalong the top of the gunwale.

Thickened \nmembers (ribs and gunwales) were modeled as shell elements with increased elastic moduli to reflect \ntheir stiffnesses in the canoe. This model was analyzed under many loading scenarios, including \nmultiple paddling cases, transportation (via the trailer and via ten people), display on stands, and \nsubmersion.

The paddlers\u2019 knees and shins were modeled as four point loads and their feet as a \nuniform area loads. By recursively determining the conditions for equilibrium of the model without \nrestraint (floating), the depth-dependent hydrostatic pressure distribution was found.  \n \nOptimizing for weight and stresses, various rib and gunwale designs were considered. Since they are \nstiffer than the shell, the ribs and gunwale alter load paths by attracting a larger share of forces, which \nin turn reduces stresses in the shell (Maekawa 2003). While these forces are of greater magnitude, they \nare distributed over the larger areas of the thickened elements, resulting in acceptable stresses.

The baseline was dark gray while the \nfinal mixes were grayish white and blue. \n \nStructural properties of trial batches were monitored through compressive strength (ASTM C39). \nCompressive strength is a good metric for many structural properties of concrete and its test is easy to \nperform.

The final \nmixes, Pale Fire and Blue Flame, were found to have strengths of 1650 and 1560 psi, elastic moduli \n(ASTM C469) of 1610 and 1536 ksi, and moduli of rupture (ASTM C78) of 487 and 475 psi, \nrespectively. The moduli of rupture are efficiently in excess of the required \n470 psi due to the presence of dispersed fiber reinforcement. A constitutive \nhybrid of 18 mm PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) microfibers and 20 mm \npolypropylene microfibers was used to derive a synergistic response \n(Banthia and Nandakumar 2003). Microfibers were used instead of \nconventional macrofibers because at low volume fractions the microfibers \nhave a higher numerical density, providing over 16 million well-dispersed \nfibers to flank and eventually bridge \nmicrocracks at onset. The stiff PVA \nmicrofibers bridge microcracks at low \ncrack widths promoting multiple small cracks to form rather than \ncoalescing, enhancing the ultimate strength and crack initiation \ntoughness of the composite.

Composed of arc lengths of varying radius, euphoria has a \nrounded appearance in plan view. This shape results in a full-ended canoe, generating two advantages: \nfirst, paddlers can be positioned toward the ends of the canoe which improves torque during turns; \nsecond, the canoe has a shallow draft, which reduces resistance, ultimately improving straight line speed \nand turning. Although a flatter keel and hard chine create more wetted surface area and increase friction \ndrag, it was deemed necessary to reduce the profile area of the canoe in order to improve turning. The \nincrease in friction drag is offset by a narrow beam to reduce wave drag while maintaining a sufficient \nstability as indicated by the moment-righting arm GZ (Gilmer and Johnson, 1982).  Comparative \ndimensions are illustrated in Table 2, below.  \n \nTo further improve turning, the team designed euphoria with six inches of rocker at the bow that tapers \nseven feet into the length of the canoe.

Throughout the tests, the engineers focused on \nthe rotating/righting arm, which provides for stability \nwithin the canoe. The larger the rotating arm, the more \nstability the canoe will have. Upon consulting the \npaddling engineer, Audrey Seals, a larger rocker was \ndesigned for this year\u2019s hull. This increased rocker allows \nthe paddlers to have more freedom to turn the canoe \nquickly and easily. The design engineers investigated the \neffect of varying depths for the rocker and found 3.5 \ninches to be an optimal value.

Friction between the screws and the \nweave held the scrim flush against the concrete \nsurface (Figure 6).

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant that writes proposals for the ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "prompt": "Write the development and testing section for an ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition.", "output": "various aggregates such as polystyrene, the \ndesigners finally made a breakthrough with \ncenospheres, 100% recycled ceramic microspheres. \nAn initial mix with 25% of cenospheres, 70% of \nPoraver\u00ae and 5% of K1 microspheres proved \npromising with a compressive strength of 1,595 psi \nand a density of 60.5 lb/ft\u00b3. Even though this did not \nrespect the design criterion, the team of designers \ndecided to press onward with this self floating \nmixture. \nNow that the team had its second recycled \naggregate, motivation was at an all time high. They \nopted to base their first mix on Vintage\u2019s final \nconcrete mixture. In order to optimize the aggregate \nmix, the proportion of cementitious materials was \nleft unchanged. After setting the proportions of K1 \nmicrospheres at 5% (maximum allowed passing \nSieve No.100), the team prepared over a dozen \ndifferent mixtures with varying amounts of different \nPoraver\u00ae. Keeping in mind the cenospheres\u2019 \nrelatively high density when compared to Poraver\u00ae, \nthe cenospheres proportions were fixed at 25%, the \n2\nMONTFERRAND 2010 \n\u00c9COLE DE TECHNOLOGIE SUP\u00c9RIEURE\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nminimum permited by the rules. This was done in \norder to ensure the final mix would have the lowest \npossible density. The optimized mix contained 25% \nof cenospheres, 70% of Poraver\u00ae (55% of Poraver\u00ae \n1-2 mm and 15% of Poraver\u00ae 0,5-1 mm) and 5% of \nK1 microspheres. This concrete mixture obtained a \ncompressive strength of 1,735 psi, a tensile strength \nof 239 psi (ASTM C496) after 14 days of curing \nand a density of 58.7 lb/ft\u00b3. \nNow that they had established their \naggregate proportions, they decided to hammer \naway at the cementitious materials. The designers \ndecided to test metakaolin due to its ability to \nincrease the concrete\u2019s compressive strength. This \nmaterial would also improve the concrete\u2019s \nworkability and aesthetics. They started by \npreparing mixes containing different proportions of \nslag and metakaolin combined with the Portland \ncement, even going as far as completely replacing \nthe slag in the mixture. The results showed that by \nreplacing a part of the slag with metakaolin, the \nmixture required more water. In order for the \ncement to have a proper hydration process, the team \nwould have to increase the amount of water in the \nmix. Consequently, the amount of cement in the \nmix would also have to be increased to respect the \nwater/cement ratio established in the rules. This \nwould in effect increase in the mixture\u2019s density. \nThe team therefore deemed this alternative \nunacceptable since mixes with metakaolin required \nmore water in comparison to mixes with equal \nproportions of slag. Because of this, they decided to \nstick with their preestablished slag and cement \nproportions of 351.84 lb/yd\u00b3, and 374.29 lb/yd\u00b3 \nrespectively. \nOne of the innovations this year was the \nstrict mixing procedure the team set forth. In \nprevious years, the concrete\u2019s ingredients were \nsimply all put together, then mixed until a uniform \npaste was acquired. While developing the final \nmixture, the designers noticed some materials, \nnamely the fibers, were not dispersed evenly \nthroughout the concrete. After a few tests, the \nfollowing sequence was established: incorporate \ncementitious materials and fibers, mix for 45 \nseconds, add latex and admixtures, mix for another \n30 seconds, add aggregates, mix for a final 45 \nseconds. This method would ensure an even \ndistribution of the materials, especially the fibers, in \n the final concrete mixture. \nAfterwards, the designers took a close look \nat the latex and admixture proportions.  The team \ndecided to keep the same proportions as last year for \nthese elements since tests performed with the new \naggregate \nand \ncementitious \nmaterials \nwere \nsatisfactory. Tests with Gillmore needles were also \nperformed and found that the mixture\u2019s workability \nwas 21 minutes (ASTM C266). This meant that the \nproportions for the final mixture were 477.83 fl \noz/cwt of Sika Latex R\u00ae, 182.87 fl oz/cwt of Albitol \nConcentrate\u00ae, 184.05 lf oz/cwt of Sika Cem 810\u00ae \n(with 30 % of silica fume) and 14.96 fl oz/cwt of \nGlenium\u00ae 7700. The latter is in line with the \nmanufacturers recommended dosage (2 to 15 fl \noz/cwt). Because of this, the design team decided to \nkeep the same curing process as last year. They kept \nthe canoe isolated for 2 days under polythene \nsheets, then 5 days of dry curing (latex coalescence) \nfollowed by 7 days in the humid chamber. This \nsequence allowed sufficient time for the latex\u2019s \ncoalescence (tests performed on Vintage) and an \noptimal curing time for the cement\u2019s hydration \nprocess.

This new fiber was \ncalled Innegra\u00ae and offered a lower density than \neither previously used fibers (52.44 lb/ft\u00b3 for \n3\nMONTFERRAND 2010 \n\u00c9COLE DE TECHNOLOGIE SUP\u00c9RIEURE\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure 4 : Plate Destroyer II \nInnegra\u00ae and 56.81 lb/ft\u00b3 for Fibermesh\u00ae). It was \ntherefore used in place of the Fibermesh\u00ae 150 in the \nsame proportions as last year\u2019s mixture along with \nFibermesh\u00ae 300. Unfortunately, at equal volumes of \nFibermesh\u00ae and Innegra\u00ae, the latter mix only \nobtained 174 psi in tensile strength (ASTM C496) \ncompared to 239 psi in tensile strength for the \nFibermesh\u00ae. The team tested varying amounts of \nInnegra\u00ae but to no avail. Considering both mixtures \nbrought forth similar cohesion, the team decided to \ngive this new fiber the axe and stick with \nVintage\u2019s fibers, Fibermesh\u00ae 300 and Fibermesh\u00ae \n150.  \nAfter the immense \nsuccess of the Plate \nDestroyer, the team of \ndesigners \ndecided \nto \npush their research even \nfurther. They found an \ninnovative new way to \ndynamically test vertical \nconcrete plates. The test \nbench was affectionately \ncalled \nthe \nPlate \nDestroyer II (see figure \n4). \nThis \ntest \nwould \ndemonstrate the effects \nof fibers in a dynamic environment and help the \nteam make an educated choice for the fiber \nproportions. \nThe first tests performed on the Destroyer \nwere static load tests on plates containing last year\u2019s \nfinal mixture (ASTM C78). The designers decided \nto base themselves on this peculiar mix in order to \nestablish the strength needed to break the samples. \nWhen analyzing the results, they came to the \nconclusion that the concrete would yield after a \nforce of roughly 5 kN was applied, after which the \nprimary reinforcement (GlasGrid\u00ae) was solicited. \nAfter consulting key members of the faculty, \nthe team of designers established that a dynamic \nload representing 50% of the static load bearing \ncapacity was appropriate. The dynamic load was \ntherefore set at 2.5 kN. This way, the team would \nensure that the mixture would be solicited \nrealistically.  \n \nIn order to have as much raw data as \npossible and to see the long term effects of the \ndynamic tests on each mixture, the team set the \namount of load cycles at 50,000. This would in turn \nreveal the effects of the competitions on the canoe\u2019s \nconcrete. \nWhen a static force of 5 kN was applied to \neach type of plate, a deflexion of about 3/16\u201d was \nobserved. Because of this, the deformation for the \ndynamic tests was restricted to 3/16\u201d. This way, if \nthis value was exceeded, the test bench would \nautomatically stop. The criteria for the dynamic \ntests were accordingly set at 50,000 cycles or a \nmaximum deflexion of 3/16\u201d. \n These dynamic tests were performed on 24 \nplates with six different fiber proportions. These \nproportions were established by having different \ncombinations of Fibermesh\u00ae 150 and Fibermesh\u00ae \n300 totalling the maximal amount of fibers \n(0.30%/volume). \n \nInitial tests were performed on plates \ncontaining last year\u2019s mixture (0.11%/volume of \nFibermesh\u00ae 150 and 0.19%/volume of Fibermesh\u00ae \n300)  and plates containing a mixture with no fibers \nat all. The results clearly show the difference \nbetween the two, with the latter mixture reaching \nthe maximal deflexion of 0.19\u201d around 30,000 \ncycles, whereas Vintage\u2019s mix had not only \nobtained a deflexion of only 0.13\u201d by this point, but \nalso managed to survive the entire loading cycle. \nThese results essentially proved the utmost \nimportance of these fibers in MONTFERRAND\u2019s \nconcrete mixture. \nThe designers then moved on to plates \ncontaining varying amounts of fibers (see figure 5). \nThe results showed that the Fibermesh\u00ae 300 had \npositive effects during dynamic tests. When looking \nat figure 5, it was clear that the mixes containing the \nmost Fibermesh\u00ae 300 excelled at the dynamic tests. \nThe unfortunate side effect of these mixes was an \nuneven distribution of the fibers in the mix. The \ndesigners also noticed that the results for the plates \ncontaining more Fibermesh\u00ae 150 beared a striking \nresemblance to the results for the plate that had no \nfibers at all. This confirms that the Fibermesh\u00ae 150 \noffers little to no advantage when it comes to tensile \nresistance. However, the positive effect it confers \nduring the cure make it a necessity in the mixture. \nIn the end, the team of designers found that the \noptimal fiber proportions for MONTFERRAND\u2019s \nconcrete would be 0.11%/volume of Fibermesh\u00ae \n150 and 0.19%/volume of Fibermesh\u00ae 300 because \n4\nMONTFERRAND 2010 \n\u00c9COLE DE TECHNOLOGIE SUP\u00c9RIEURE\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure 5 : Dynamic test results on six different fiber \nproportions with the Plate Destroyer II \nFigure 6 : Sources of income for Montferrand\u2019s team \nthey offered the best mechanical resistance with \nevenly distributed fibers in the mix, coupled with \nreduced shrinkage cracking.

This \nis a chance for the team to meet its new leaders. The \nleaders in turn highlight last year\u2019s strong points and \nshortcomings. \nConsidering the incredible success enjoyed \nlast year, the same management style was kept. This \nmeant that someone different would be put in \ncharge of every part of the project. Due to the loss \nof many senior team members, seven out of a \npossible eight project leaders were new to the job, \nincluding the captain. Fortunately, last year\u2019s \ncaptain decided to stay onboard for consulting as a \nsupportive member. \n \nNext on the agenda were the annual \nrecruitment activities held in September. Since only \n13 members returned from Vintage, recruiting \nrookies was a priority to ensure the continuity of the \nteam. In total, 14 new students joined the project. \nThis was the direct result of an aggressive recruiting \ncampaign. \nThe management team had been trained by \nhaving tasks delegated to them in previous years. \nHaving found this experience incredibly beneficial, \nthe team decided to integrate first year members in \nthe same way and delegate tasks directly to them. \nFor example, first year members were tasked with \nbuilding the canoe\u2019s supports and keeping the \nwebsite up to date. This would greatly alleviate the \nworkload for senior members, considering that out \nof the 27 students, only half had participated in the \nConcrete Canoe beforehand. In doing so, they \nwould also be training the team\u2019s future leaders. \nDuring the first meeting, a list of overall \nobjectives and goals was presented so the new team \ncould move forward as a whole with a common \nmindset. It\u2019s at this time that the newer members \nwere informed of the financial implications.

We studied the fundamental \nconcepts of hydrostatics and hydrodynamics and \ndetermined that a combined mass (weight) [boat \nand crew] equal to 226.8 kg (500 lb) would be \nrequired to overcome the excessive rocker in the \ndesign so that maximum hull speed could be \nobtained. This mass (weight) provides sufficient \ndraft [12.1 cm (4.75 in.)] so that the bow is \nslightly submerged, with the waterline extending \nalong the entire length of the canoe. Along with \nproper trim and hydrodynamic stability, this \ncritical depth allows the hull to displace water \nefficiently and gives the largest possible waterline \nlength, the square root of which is directly \nproportional to the hull speed. \nThe point of intersection between two vertical \nlines, one line through the center of buoyancy of \nthe hull in equilibrium and the other line through \nthe center of buoyancy of the hull when the canoe \nis inclined to one side is called the metacenter. \nThe distance of this intersection above the center \nof gravity is an indication of the stability of the \ncanoe. As illustrated below (from Ibrahim and \nGrace 2010), as long as the metacenter is located \nabove the center of gravity, the righting arm has a \nstabilizing effect to bring our canoe back to its \noriginal position. Since it is desirable to keep the \ncenter of gravity as low as possible, we decided \nto place our canoe within a female mold so that \nany extra concrete needed to obtain the target \nweight could be placed at the bottom of the hull \nwithout changing its external dimensions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWe also recorded videos of our team and \nscrutinized others taken of our major competitors \n(Madison, Reno, and ETS) to improve our racing \nskills.

So \nwe followed a comprehensive trial and error mix \ndesign process to arrive at our final selections. \nWe relied on a method developed at UAH for \nfabricating structurally equivalent reinforced \nconcrete composite plates (Raut et al. 2004). We \nplaced the benchmark that had a known elastic \nmodulus over our reinforcement scheme and \nloaded a specimen [10.2 cm (4 in.) wide by 35.6 \ncm (14.0 in.) long] to failure in pure bending \n(following ASTM C78). As we varied the \nconstituents in the benchmark, we determined the \nelastic modulus of the new mix by comparing the \ncenter deflections of a plate constructed with it to \nthat of the plate constructed with the benchmark. \nWe placed all of our plates on a vertical \ntemplate and measured the thickness variations \nfrom top to bottom so that shrinkage and \nconsolidation could be taken into account during \nthe placement of our canoe. This procedure \nallowed us to perform concrete mix design while \nstudying, concurrently, the impact a change in \nconstituents had on the overall structural \nperformance of our composite. Once we had \nachieved the desired composite properties, we \ntested the concrete mixes alone.   \nWe tested a total of 21 different concrete \nmixes and Appendix B lists the mix proportions \nfor the two mixes that we developed to place our \ncanoe. The basic constituents are the same but \nfree fibers were added to the one used in the \ncentral layer to improve the flexural strength and \nbonding capabilities. Fibers were not included in \nthe outer layers, since they decreased workability, \nfinishability, and overall appearance. \nBinder Selection: We used white Portland \ncement (ASTM C150), granulated blast-furnace \nslag (ASTM C989), and metakaolin (ASTM \nC618) to bind our final mixes, and made sure that \nall requirements on mass were satisfied (Section \n3.3.1; NCCC Rules 2010). We used the slag to \nprovide longer lasting workability; metakaolin \nwas incorporated to reduce shrinkage and \nincrease strength and durability. The binders were \nalso selected to lighten the color of the concrete. \nAggregate Selection: We added Poraver \nand white cenospheres to satisfy the requirements \nimposed on aggregate proportioning (Section \n3.3.2; NCCC Rules 2010). Both materials are \nlightweight recyclables (see page 7). Poraver are \nexpanded spheres that have fine air chambers \ninside (Poraver 2010) while cenospheres are \nhollow and thin-walled (Sphere Services 2010). \nWhile designing our mix, we allowed only 95% \n(by weight) of the particles to remain on the No. \n100 sieve (see Appendix C for details). \nSecondary Reinforcement: We studied \nthe effects of adding different polymer based \nmicro-fibers to our mix (Feleko\u011flu et al. 2009) \nand learned that debonding could occur between \nthem and the matrix due to shear deformation and \nfiber sliding (Friedrich et al. 2005). As a result, \nwe used poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) fibers because \nthey minimize debonding while increasing \nflexural strength and bridging micro-cracks. \nPVA fibers have a high tensile strength, a \nhigh modulus, and low specific gravity. Their \nhydrophilic nature causes them to bond well with \nthe cementitious matrix (Wang and Li 2006). The \nenhanced bonding is attributed to the effect PVA \nhas on the nucleation of CH and CSH at the fiber \nsurface and on the presence of polymer around \nthe fibers (Feldman and Barbalata 1996). \nAdmixtures: We used four admixtures, \nthree of which were liquid. Latex was used to \nenhance the bonding and flexibility of our matrix. \nWe added an air entrainment admixture \n(ASTM C260) at 739 ml (25 oz) per 45.4 kg (100 \nlb) of cementitious materials to reduce weight and \nachieve the minimum air content (Section 3.34, \nNCCC Rules 2010). The overdose (6.25 times \nthat recommended) had no detrimental effects. \nA high range water reducer (ASTM C494) \nwas added at a dosage of 414 ml (14 oz) per 45.4 \nkg (100 lb) of cementitious materials to increase \nworkability while keeping the water-cementitious \nmaterials ratio below 0.4 (Section 3.3.3; NCCC \nRules 2010). The addition of this constituent at a \ndosage slightly above that recommended by the \nmanufacturer [354 ml (12 oz) per 45.4 kg (100 lb) \nof cementitious materials], helped improve the \nsurface finish when used in conjunction with our \npowder admixture: Poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB). \nPVB (specifically, Butvar B-79) was selected \nbecause of its adhesion, binding efficiency, \ntoughness, \nflexibility, \nand \nwater-proofing \nproperties (Toutanji et al. 2010; Xu et al. 2010). \nThe product comes in the form of a lightweight \nsolid white powder that does not crosslink or \nform polymers or covalent bonds. \nAs illustrated below (from Lavin et al. 2008), \nButvar contains hydroxyl groups that have the \npotential to form a hydrogen bond between \nmolecules, or within different parts of a single \nmolecule.

The ITZ is the weakest link in a \nnormal concrete mix and interactions there affect \nproperties such as strength, permeability, and \ndurability. It is an area of high water transport \nand water accumulation and relatively poor \nmineral formation which leads to micro alkali \nsilica reactions (ASR) and ettringite formation. \nSince PVB is partially hydrophilic, it acts as a \nsponge that absorbs excess water. We believe that \nPVB regulates the ITZ by stopping ASR while \ndonating excess water for cement hydration."}

This unique \nfeature provides remarkable changes in the \nsurface bond strength, not only between the \naggregate and the matrix, but also between the \nfibers and the matrix. Additionally, the ether \noxygen functional groups act as a weak base that \npotentially interacts with Lewis acids in cement \npaste components like CSH. \nPVB is a mixed hydrophilic and hydrophobic \nmolecule \nsupplied \nas \na \nwater \ninsoluble \namorphous granule soluble only in organic \nsolvents yet which partially hydrates in water. Its \nunique binding and absorption characteristics can \nbe used to design mixes with distinctive \nproperties (Gilbert et al. 2008) like ours.  \nThe interfacial transition zone (ITZ) is \ncharacterized by the prevalence of calcium \nhydroxide and higher porosity, and, as mentioned \npreviously, it is the weakest region in a normal \nconcrete mix. Our addition of Butvar is in stark \ncontrast to traditional methods that have been \napplied to improve the aggregate/matrix bonding \nin this zone, such as reducing the size of the \naggregates (Ak\u00e7aolu et al. 2002; Ak\u00e7aolu et al. \n2004), using basalt and quartzite as aggregates \n(Tasong et al. 1999), or replacing the cement with \nultrafine additions of constituents, such as silica \nfume and metakaolin (Bentz 2000; Asbridge et al. \n2004; Poon et al. 2001). These traditional \nmethods are limited in scope, since they do not \nsignificantly alter the nature of the interaction \nbetween the aggregate and the matrix. The bond \nstrength between traditional steel and glass fibers \nis limited whereas our addition of PVA fibers \ncapitalizes on their hydrophilic nature to create a \nsuperior bond with the cementitious matrix. \nSustainability: Our concrete mix relies on \ngranulated blast-furnace slag, a nonmetallic co-\nproduct produced in the production of iron, as one \nof our binders; and, includes Poraver and \ncenospheres as recycled aggregates.

A baseline mixture was developed with 0.6 water/cementitious materials (w/cm) ratio, \n10 percent design air content, and 400 pcy cementitious materials content. The cementitious materials \nincorporated 50 percent Type I white portland cement, 40 percent vitro calcium aluminosilicate \n(VCAS-8\u2122), and 10 percent Komponent\u00ae, an expansive cement additive, by weight. This produced a \nconcrete with a unit weight of 62.2 pcf and a 28-day compressive strength of 2,200 psi. \n \nInitial trial mixtures had high w/cm ratios to increase workability; however, several of these batches \ndid not meet the desired unit weight and strength. Improving upon the mixtures involved changing one \nparameter at a time to obtain the final structural and patch mixtures. The first constituents tested for \nBlack\uf073Diamond were the two sustainable aggregates. Poraver\u00ae Siscorspheres were selected due to \nan abundant supply and success from previous years. Selection of the second sustainable aggregate \nbegan by batching with several trial aggregates including crushed tile, glass highway spheres, plastic \nshavings, and plastic airsoft pellets. Iterative batches with crushed tile \nand glass highway spheres yielded unit weights from 62.0 pcf to 70.0 pcf, \nwhich did not meet the team\u2019s goal. Snowboard shavings, with a specific \ngravity of 0.95, were more lightweight but produced an unworkable and \nnon-compactable concrete mixture with rebounding behavior. Finally, \nused airsoft pellets (Figure 3) were crushed to obtain a desirable \ngradation and were combined with Poraver\u00ae Siscorspheres to produce a \nwell-graded mixture meeting ASTM D6913-04 standards. After several \niterations, the airsoft pellets produced satisfactory results in terms of \nworkability, unit weight, and strength.  \n \nFigure 3: Used Airsoft \nPellets. \n \n3 \n \n \n \nOnce suitable aggregates were established, admixture selection and corresponding dosage rates were \ndetermined. Daravair\u00ae, an air-entraining admixture (AEA), was removed from the structural mixture \nwhen the team noticed trial concrete batches with airsoft pellets yielded air contents ranging from 12 to \n15 percent and unit weights lower than 55.0 pcf, which is the minimum limit set by the competition \nrules (ASCE/NCCC, 2010). Rhoplex\u00ae, a polymer modifying admixture (PMA), was used to reduce \nwet curing from 28 to 14 days while increasing adhesion, water resistance, and workability. A \nviscosity modifying admixture (VMA) and high range water reducer (HRWR) were used to yield a \nmore fluid and cohesive concrete mixture. The team also added Daraset\u00ae, a set accelerating admixture, \nduring trial batching to increase early compressive \nstrength by 450 psi, which was obtained using \nASTM C39-10. Admixture dosage rates were \nincreased in small proportions for each trial batch, \neventually \nexceeding \nrecommended \ndosages \n(Table \n3) \nto \nobtain \nthe \ndesired \nmixture \ncharacteristics. The team contacted manufacturers \nand confirmed that the increased dosages would \nhave no adverse effects on the concrete properties. \n \nTo improve flexural strength and ductility of the concrete, the mix design team incorporated two sizes \nof polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers (6 mm and 12 mm in length). Excessive clumping of the two sizes in \nBattle Born prompted the team to adjust the amount per volume used in the mixture from 0.4 \npercent to 0.3 percent to promote better dispersion for improved performance. A fiber dispersing \npowder, GST 1200 GX, facilitated uniform dispersion as well. The mix design team further \nstrengthened the concrete with chemical prestressing by adding Komponent\u00ae cement additive to create \nType K expansive cement (ASTM C845-04). The expansion in the concrete is restrained by the carbon \nfiber reinforcement, causing the concrete to develop internal compressive stresses to keep the \ncomposite in equilibrium. Type K expansive prestressing added an additional 300 psi of multi-\ndirectional prestress to the concrete and caused enough expansion to offset a portion of shrinkage \ncracking experienced during hydration. \n \nThe final structural mixture consisted of 50 percent Type I white portland cement, 40 percent VCAS-\n8\u2122, and 10 percent Komponent\u00ae of the 585 pcy cementitious material content. Aggregates included \nPoraver\u00ae Siscorspheres ranging in size from 0.1 mm to 2 mm, totaling 74.3 percent by mass, and \nairsoft pellets amounting to 25.7 percent by mass, producing a mixture with 100 percent recycled \naggregate. To effectively fill in the air voids on the surface of the canoe, a patch mixture incorporated \nglass highway spheres ranging in size from 0.3 mm to 0.8 mm.

To complete the reinforcement, steel mesh was \nused at the bow and stern due to its high malleability.  \n \nMonolithic casting of the canoe began by hand-packing concrete through the \nreinforcement; this technique allowed the team to prestress the canoe, pre-place \nreinforcement to the required specifications and cast the canoe in a single layer, \npreventing delamination of the final product. Two experienced mixing teams \nbatched concrete simultaneously and veteran members oversaw the casting process \nas a quality control measure for a consistent 0.5\u201d thickness.

After \ncasting, the canoe was covered with wet sheets and wrapped in Visquine.  \n \nFinishing began with iterations of sanding and patching after seven days of curing. \nFourteen days after the original casting day, longitudinal and transverse tendons \nwere released and cut, and concrete was cast over the exposed tendon ends. However, the team noticed \na transverse crack 6\u201d from the stern of the canoe. After tendon release, the crack propagated into the \nchine while another crack became evident near the bow. The team investigated possible reasons for the \ncracking, concluding that either: (1) the wood support underneath the bulkhead at the bow and the \nstern adhered to the concrete causing tensile stresses; (2) forces were not evenly applied to all sides \nduring form removal; or (3) the parabolic shape of the tendon paths generated stresses at the ends.  The \nteam\u2019s managers decided to remove the concrete around the crack, exposing the steel mesh \nreinforcement (Figure 7), and then cast a larger bulkhead to support the area. \n \nNext, the team built a slotted wooden frame to simultaneously place five manufactured plastic cross-\nsectional templates at 1\u2019 intervals over the canoe to administer an average depth control, as discussed \nin the Innovation and Sustainability section.

This method was further perfected by using the exact materials and \nprocesses as used in professional practice. \nMold injection is commonly used to make a variety of products but was yet to be applied to create a concrete \ncanoe. In order to use this method to create Andromeda, extensive research was done on professional mold \nmaking. Prior to the start of the project, several members attended a  mold making class at a local college \nto determine the best mold making tools, materials, and procedures for this application. This class also \ngave access to experts in mold making and concrete injection which provided additional information and \nmentoring to develop the best way to achieve successful mold injection. \nImprovements began with the forms used to create the \nmolds. In past years, the forms were hand fabricated from \n1 lb Styrofoam which produced inaccuracies in the molds. \nThis year, the 1.5 lb Styrofoam forms were cut precisely \nusing a computer numerical control (CNC) machine which \nincreased the quality control of the hull dimensions. The \nCNC cut female mold form is shown in Figure 8. Using \nthe CNC machine also greatly reduced the time required to \nmake the forms and kept the project on schedule. Next, the \nforms were sealed with latex paint, coated with Duratec, \nand \ufb01 nely sanded to a smooth surface. A thin layer of mold \nrelease wax and \ufb01 berglass mold release was applied to \neasily remove the Styrofoam form once the \ufb01 berglass mold \nwas built. \nThe mold material selection was solely based on materials used in professional practice. Before the \napplication of the \ufb01 berglass, a gel coat was applied to the cut foam forms. Gel coat was selected because \nof its ability to be sanded smoothly and directly mimic the foam forms, since this surface would be the \ncontact surface for the concrete in the \ufb01 nal mold. A red gel coat was used for the female mold and a clear \ngel coat for the male mold. This was done as a quality control practice to make any voids visible during the \ninjection process. Next, four \ufb01 berglass layers were applied to the gel coat and wood reinforcing ribs were \nadded later to withstand the injection pressures of mold injection. In the previous year, ribs were added at \n18\u201d increments, which had shown to be insuf\ufb01 cient and under reinforced. This year, more ribs were added \nat 9\u201d increments, shown in Figure 9, to each mold to prevent any mold de\ufb02 ection.

It is for these reasons the wolf represents the University of Nevada, \nReno as well as the 2012 Nevada Concrete Canoe Team. \nFirst established in the city of Elko in 1874, the University of Nevada moved 300 miles west to Reno \nin 1885. The first diplomas were presented to a graduating class of three in 1891. The university has \nbeen advancing ever since with new opportunities for research and access to advancing technologies. \nThe university\u2019s engineering earthquake research center is currently undergoing a multi-million dollar \nexpansion, which will make it one of the world\u2019s largest facilities for earthquake simulation and \nresearch. Over 14,000 undergraduate students are enrolled at the university, 426 of whom study in the \nuniversity\u2019s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.  \nSeven Northern California schools compete alongside Nevada in the Mid-Pacific Conference. The \nUniversity of Nevada began competing consistently at the conference level in 2005, after a seven year \nabsence from the competition. They earned their first trip to nationals in 2006, where they placed sixth \noverall. In 2007, they placed third overall with Cerulean and won their first national title in 2008 \nwith Argentum. Since then, Nevada has been a perennial national competitor with FUSION (5th, 2009), \nBattle Born (2nd, 2010), and Black\uf073Diamond (5th, 2011).  \nThe 2012 team developed new \ntechniques that emphasized time, \nlabor, and resource efficiencies. The \nproject manager set an ambitious \ngoal to cast the canoe before winter \nbreak, allotting the team more time \nto focus on the concrete finish and graphics. The mix design team developed four different concrete \nmixes (Table 1) to minimize the overall weight of the canoe, decrease time spent on sanding, and \nimprove graphic quality. The final canoe specifications are listed in Table 2."}

The team focused on three interdependent \nparameters to begin the design process: speed, tracking, and maneuverability. The elimination of the \nslalom course from the competition encouraged a design focused on increased straight-line speed.  \nThe top speed of a canoe is limited largely by wave drag (Slade, 1998), which is determined by the \nsubmerged shape of the canoe. Creating a greater length-to-beam ratio by lengthening and narrowing \nthe shape of the canoe resulted in less drag and a higher top speed.

Through in-depth research, interviews with \nveteran paddlers, and thorough modeling, ConquistaGator was \ndesigned with a unique hull geometry that capitalized on \nmaneuverability and low resistance while improving on the \nsuccessful elements of previous canoes. \nUsing \u00a0last \u00a0year\u2019s \u00a0hull \u00a0as \u00a0a \u00a0baseline, \u00a0the \u00a0goal \u00a0was \u00a0to \u00a0reduce \u00a0resistance \u00a0due \u00a0to \u00a0wetted \u00a0surface \u00a0area \u00a0and \u00a0hull \u00a0\nshape.  Since frictional resistance can be managed by simply decreasing surface area, efficient hull \nshape became the dominant design challenge.  Through multiple shape iterations, wavemaking \nresistance was decreased thereby improving acceleration.  \nHull shape was characterized by the prismatic coefficient, entrance angle, and buttocks angle.  The \nprismatic coefficient, a measure of hull fineness, was kept within the optimal range of 0.51 to 0.56 (Gerr \n1992).  Entrance angle and buttocks angle were also minimized to prevent boundary layer separation and \ndecrease resistance (Zardi 2000).  \nIncreasing maneuverability required more rocker in both stern and bow sections than in previous years.  \nA total of four inches of rocker was introduced in the stern to aid with driving. Five inches of rocker in \nthe bow allowed water to flow laterally under the boat during bow initiated turns.    \nOptimizing the shape began to constrain critical parameters such as stability and required draft.  To \nmitigate this, the hull was designed with a slight asymmetry to preserve displacement and a transitional \nchine that is round astern and hard toward the bow.

To distribute the buoyant force along the hull of the canoe, \nConquistaGator was split into three-inch sections and the wetted surface area of each section was \nmultiplied by the hydrostatic pressure. Male and female paddlers were assumed to be 250 and 150 \npounds respectively. The canoe weight was set at an assumed 170 pounds and distributed along the hull \nin the same manner as the buoyant force. The ultimate moment was determined to occur amidships \nduring the two-man sprint with a maximum negative moment of 11,100 pound-inches.  \nThe midship section of the canoe was analyzed using the transformed area method. This method, while \nassuming the outer layer of concrete had cracked, provided the location of the neutral axis. The material \nvalues used for the concrete were 500 ksi and 100 psi for the modulus and tensile strength respectively. \nThese values, along with a composite flexural strength of 1000 psi for the inner two layers, were \nobtained \u00a0by \u00a0analyzing \u00a0last \u00a0year\u2019s \u00a0mix \u00a0data and set as the minimum requirements for ConquistaGator. \nThe material data sheet for the carbon fiber reinforcing mesh supplied the modulus and tensile strength \nvalues of 33.4 Msi and 512 ksi respectively.

Paddlers also pull their \npaddles perpendicular to the canoe.

Each day he \nwould sail across the morning sky, balancing the sun on his head in his morning boat, and each evening \nhe would plunge into the realm of the Underworld in his evening boat, Mesektet.

Starting from the baseline mix, the \nK37 microspheres [specific gravity (SG) = \n0.37; Crush Strength (CS) = 3,000 psi] were \nreplaced with iM16K (SG = 0.46; CS =16,500 \npsi) and iM30K (SG = 0.6; CS = 28,000 psi) \nglass bubbles (3M, 2008; 2010; 2013). This \nincreased the average specific gravity of our \nmicrosphere aggregates by 52%, but because it \nincreased the average compressive strength by \n732%, the replacement was desirable. \nIncreased strength was also achieved by \ndesigning the aggregate proportions to match a \nmodified version of the gradation curve for \nmaximum density proposed by Fuller and \nThompson (1906). An optimal gradation \nwould minimize the voids between the \naggregates, providing a more cohesive mix \nand \ngreater \nstrength. \nThe \naggregate \nproportions were initially adjusted according \nto the standard Fuller Curve. This provided a \nconcrete mix that was too coarse to be used, so \nthe team modified the Fuller Curve to \ncompensate \nfor \nfiner \naggregates. \nThis \nproduced a gradation that resulted in a very \nworkable mix. This gradation increased the \ncompressive strength by 37%, while only \nincreasing the total aggregate weight by 6.4% \ncompared to last year\u2019s mix. A comparative \ngraph between the gradations used for Old \nEphraim and Canoebis against the modified \nFuller curve is shown in Figure 5. \n \nFigure 5: Gradation vs. modified fuller curve \n \nImproved concrete tensile capacity was \nobtained by adding fibrous material to the \nstructural mix. Old Ephraim\u2019s two fiber sizes \nwere 8 and 130 deniers. The team added two \nadditional sizes of PVA fibers, 20 and 40 \ndeniers, to provide a greater range. Because \nfibers of similar size tend to clump together, \nthis range allowed the concrete to have more \nfibers without sacrificing workability. Tensile \nstrength was increased by 50% over last year\u2019s \nmix. \nStriving to minimize voids in the aggregate \ngradation resulted in a stiffer, denser concrete \nmix. This made it difficult to entrain air using \nthe standard method of mixing. A new mixing \ntechnique \nwas \nused to reach the \ndesired \nair \ncontent. First, the \nwater, \nair \nentrainer, \nand \nother admixtures\nwere added to the \ncementitious \nmaterial \nand \nmixed \nat \nhigh \nspeeds for several \nminutes (see Fig. \n6). This long mixing time ensured air was \nthoroughly entrained in the slurry.

This \nmethod allowed the concrete to be very \nworkable and achieve a zero-inch slump \n(ASTM C143, 2012c) with a 4.38% air \ncontent. \nAdding admixtures further enhanced the \nworkability of the mix. Admixtures were \ntested independently to determine the correct \ndosage for the overall mix. The team used a \nhigher dosage of air entrainer compared to Old \nEphraim\u2019s concrete mix. This ensured the mix \nwould obtain a high enough air content to \nachieve the desired unit weight. A high range \nwater reducer and super-plasticizer were also \nadded to retard the setting time and improve \nthe workability of the concrete.  \nThe team stored all aggregates at their \nsaturated surface-dry (SSD) state to increase \nworkability time and ensure a consistent mix. \nAn aggregate at SSD has reached its \nabsorption potential without excess water \nclinging to the surface, which means it will not \ncontribute or absorb any free water to the mix \n(NPCA, 2010).  First, the dry aggregates were \npremeasured into manageable batches. The \namount of water required for aggregate \nabsorption was calculated and thoroughly \nmixed into each batch. The individual batches \nwere then sealed until ready to mix. Ensuring \nthe aggregates were SSD prior to the final \nmixing meant that they would not absorb the \nwater required by the cement. This helped \nmaintain \na \nconsistent \nworkability \nlevel \nthroughout the casting process. \n \nSustainability \nIn an effort to keep our mix design \nsustainable, Canoebis was built using recycled \naggregates, such as Poraver\u00a9 and CW300 \ncenospheres. Poraver\u00a9 uses crushed recycled \nglass to create their product. Cenospheres are \ncreated from a byproduct of burning coal. Both \nof these processes require no new raw \nmaterials and reduce the impact on landfills. \nThe team also used fly ash, an industrial \nbyproduct \nof \ncombustion, \nas \na \nmain \ncomponent of the cementitious material. The \nuse of fly ash as a substitute for Portland \ncement increased the strength and workability \nof the mix while reducing the environmental \nimpact of Canoebis. The production of \nPortland cement is a major contributor to \nworldwide CO2 emissions  (Mehta, 2004). By \nreplacing Portland cement with fly ash at a 5:8 \nash/cement ratio, the team used an available \nresource that would otherwise take up space in \na landfill and reduced the use of a product with \na large carbon footprint. \n \nTest Results \nTest cylinders were cast and tested \naccording to ASTM standards (see Fig. 7) with \neach new mix to \nhelp \nthe \nteam \ntrack \nimprovements. \nThese \ncylinders \nwere \nused \nto \ncalculate \nthe \ncompressive \nstrength \n(ASTM \nC39, \n2012a), \ntensile \nstrength \n(ASTM \nC496, \n2011), the unit weight, and air content.

When the two bow and two \nstern paddlers are situated closer together [at 3.5 ft. (m), 5.5 ft. (f), 14.5 ft. \n(f) and 16.5 ft. (m) from the bow], a negative 220 ft-lb moment is induced. \nAs female paddlers are repositioned to 8 ft. and 12 ft., making the loading \nmore evenly distributed, a positive 252 ft-lb moment is generated. The \nlargest bending moment (855 ft-lb) occurs on land while in the simply-\nsupported condition (on display), resulting in a compressive stress of 189 \npsi in the gunwale and a 61 psi tensile stress in the bilge.  Inverting the \ncanoe results in the tensile stress of 189 psi now in the gunwale (Table 5).   \nThe extreme static condition of the canoe displaced to the point that the \nwaterline matches the top of gunwale was used to evaluate stresses in the \nchines. In this case, the sidewall and chine are modeled as a cantilevered \nbeam with hydrostatic pressure acting as a linearly distributed load. The \nresulting -10.4 ft-lb moment induces stresses of 160 psi in the chines.  A \nshear stress of 33 psi occurs at the transition of sidewall to the chine in this \nmaximum displacement scenario but is lower than the shearing stresses \nfound in other load scenarios (Table 5). Comparatively, a compressive \nstrength of 117 psi is needed for a 5/8 in. thick plate to resist the puncture shearing stress (ACI 318) caused by a male \npaddler shifting his weight onto the effective area of one knee which is taken as 4 5/8 in. x 4 5/8  in. square.   \nDynamic load amplification (DLA) factors are routinely applied to account for paddler momentum during races \nwith the most commonly accepted value of 1.25 (Paradis and Morency 2006).  Noting that higher factors (up to 2.2) \nwere recommended in the same canoe used in that study (Paradis and Gendron 2006), our team applied a DLA of 2.5 \nto further account for variability of natural frequencies resulting from different hull thickness, shape and geometry.   \nStresses during transit are minimal since the canoe is continuously supported in a container. However, damage \nsustained by previous canoes in transit has led to the elimination of our practice of strapping them down and constraining \nit which result in stress concentrations along the sidewalls. Lastly, designers evaluated the lifting of the canoe with a \nportable hoist to determine the appropriate number and location of straps to provide support in the demolding process.  \nThe properties of the concrete and reinforced composite are compared to the structural demands to determine the \nsafety index (Table 10, Page 6). The \u03b2 of 3.5 (1-in-10,000 chance of failure due to either excessive load or understrength) \nserves as the benchmark for comparison (MacGregor et al. 2004).  As discussed in"}

A total of 17 mixtures formulated per the Absolute Volume \nMethod (ACI 211.1) were tested per industry standards (Table 6) and their \u201cshoot-\nability\u201d evaluated through small-scale tests.  Our 2013 mixture (68 pcf; 1,700 psi) \nof Type I portland cement, Class F fly ash, metakaolin and silica fume with a blend \nof two microspheres, expanded shale and polymeric spheres (Drexel 2013) was \nused as the baseline. Refinements were made with the goals of maintaining \nmoderate strength and low unit weight, evaluating new aggregate sources, \naddressing microsphere absorption issues and reducing \u201cset up\u201d time.  \nThe minimum c/cm ratio of 0.30 (ASCE 2013) offers flexibility in using supplementary cementitious materials \n(SCM) such as industrial by-products to lower density, enhance engineering properties and increase sustainability. Such \nuse in Drexel canoes can be traced back four decades when local incinerator residue was used in a project focusing on \nwaste utilization (Berkovitz et al.1973).  In trial batches, the total cm content ranged from 750 to 1100 pcy to provide \nenough medium for spread, stability and viscosity. Type I portland cement (ASTM C150) was held between 40% to \n50% (by mass), while Class F fly ash (ASTM C618), a by-product of coal-fired furnaces at power generation facilities, \nwas incorporated between 25% and 40%.  Mixtures also included metakaolin (ASTM C618), silica fume (ASTM \nC1240) or a combination of the two.  Produced from heating kaolin clay, metakaolin increases concrete strength when \nused as a replacement for cement content up to 15% (Sabir et al. 2001).  Silica fume, known for its improvements \nstemming from the addition of an extremely fine powder to the binder paste (Detwiler and Mehta 1989), was added \nbetween 5% and 10% to limit water demand and the potential for brittle concrete (Carette and Malhotra 1983).  \nTwo new sustainable aggregate sources, Rotocell\u00ae \nand cork, were evaluated as potential substitutes in this \nyear\u2019s mixture. An expanded pumice, Rotocell\u00ae was \nconsidered for its rough texture and light weight, but was \nhighly absorptive (100%+) and clogged the shotcrete \ngun.  As a result, it was eliminated early on in the design \nprocess. Polymeric spheres (Elemix\u2122) are extremely \nlightweight (SG = 0.04), however, they were difficult to \nwork with in the shotcrete last year. A suitable \nalternative was found in cork which is well known for its \nresilient \nnature, \nelasticity, \nimpermeability \nand \nenvironmental friendliness. The particular granules used are 1 to 2 mm in diameter, include a portion of recycled wine \ncorks and were locally available (Maryland).  Cork has properties similar to those of the polymeric spheres, such as \nvery low specific gravity and no absorption (Table 7), and replaces the Elemix\u2122 spheres one for one.   \nKnown for low specific gravities, high crush strengths, spherical shape and fineness, various microspheres are \nextensively used in concrete canoes.  Our experience with Siscorspheres\u2122 conditioned to the manufacturer\u2019s absorption \nvalues (Poraver 2011) resulted in dry mixtures with little to no \nworkability, leading to the conclusion that it soaks up mix water.  \nThere are discrepancies in the values reported by others and our \nown"}

The nearly spherical shape of the aggregates selected \nallow the constituents to flow over and around one another minimizing internal stresses and increasing workability. The \ncomposite aggregate accounts for nearly 44% of the shotcrete volume but only 14% of its weight.  The fineness of the \ncomposite gradation (0.25 to 2 mm) results in a uniform, easy to sand finish exhibiting low surface voids (bugholes). \nThe dosages of admixtures were determined on a trial-and-\nerror basis using the manufacturer\u2019s recommended dosages as a \nguide (Table 9). Type S hydrated lime (ASTM C207) was added \nfor its controlled plasticity, workability and ability to improve \nstrength and durability by converting inert binders into calcium \nsilicate hydrate.

Drilled cores and sawed \nbeams obtained from test panels (Figure 8) using the same mixtures yielded higher \ndensities (67 to 79 pcf) and higher compressive strengths (~20 to 30%).  This is most \nlikely attributed to a higher compactive effort of shotcreting compared to rodding \nlayers in test cylinders. Oven-dried cylinders of rodded and shotcreted mixtures \nexhibited a 10 to 20 pcf decrease in density, most likely resulting from the release of \nrelatively large amount of water retained within the microspheres.

The team \nused ASTM C78 for flexural strength, ASTM C39 \nfor compressive strength, ASTM C469 for \nYoung\u2019s Modulus, and ASTM C138 for density \nand gravimetric air content. Each batch tested was \nprepared in laboratory conditions, and moist cured \nfor 7 days for the mix design and 28 days for the \nfinal mix. Hull mix batches were shot and \nstructural elements mix batches were hand placed, \nensuring representative specimens. \nLaval used shotcrete for the hull as high \nvelocity enables compaction and provides micro-\nfiber orientation. The 2-D alignment nearly \ndoubles fibers\u2019 efficiency compared to 3-D \nrandom orientation (Bentur & Mindess, 2007). \nMoreover, shotcrete allows the placement of an \nextremely thin layer of about 1/16 in. Wanting to \nmake Maximus a more sustainable canoe, the team \ndecided to keep the cement matrix used for \nBorealis (2012) and \u00c9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re (2013), as previous \nexperience and data proved its efficiency. It \nincluded 44% v/v Type I white Portland cement, \n26% v/v class F fly ash and 30% v/v silica fume. \nA w/cm ratio of 0.7 was also used as it allows \nproper workability and reduces unit weight.  \nIn order to achieve the perfect hull mix, the \nteam tried various combinations by adjusting the \ncementitious paste (35.5%-41.8% v/v) and 0.25 \nPVA \nmicro-fibers \n(1.20%-1.80% \nv/v). \nLightweight was an important parameter as the \nhull mix represents 80% of the concrete used for \nthe canoe. Different aggregates such as Poraver\u00a9 \n(0.25-0.5 and 0.1-0.3) and K1\u00a9, K15\u00a9, K25\u00a9, \nK37\u00a9, and K46\u00a9 were also tested in various \nproportions. The mix offering the optimal \nmechanical properties, workability and low unit \nweight was found at a cementitious paste \nproportion of 36.0% v/v and a PVA micro-fibers \nproportion of 1.65% v/v. The aggregates were 9% \nPoraver\u00a9 0.1-0.3, 65% K15\u00a9 and 26% K37\u00a9. The \nusage of recycled materials and industrial residues \nsuch as Poraver\u00a9, silica fume and fly ash, reduced \nMaximus\u2019 ecological footprint. \nSince shotcrete is not appropriate for closed \nnarrow spaces, the team had to develop a hand-\nplaced mix for the structural elements.

Final \nmixes mechanical properties for cyclical loading \nexceeded design values. \nIn order to optimize structural elements\u2019 \nefficiency, this year\u2019s team decided to push further \nits understanding of concrete behavior and energy \nabsorption. Since the gunwales are submitted to \nimportant tensile stresses during the races and \noften undergo wide cracking, the team decided to \ntest reinforced and non-reinforced structural \nconcrete samples using a third-point loading test \n(ASTM C1609).  \nThree \nnon-reinforced \nspecimens \nwere \nsubmitted to third-point loading and demonstrated \nimpressive strain-hardening capacities. As the \nstrain-deflection curves demonstrate in Figure 6, \nthe concrete can undergo greater stresses once the \nfirst crack appears. Represented by the area under \nthe curve, the absorbed energy needed for the \napparition of the second crack is inferior to the \nenergy causing the opening of the first crack. The \nconcrete is therefore subjected to great deflections \nbefore rupturing. This behavior is mostly due to \nthe addition of PVA fibers in the concrete mixture. \nAlthough the concrete shows very interesting \nfeatures, the sample displays wide cracking which \nis not the desired behavior. \nThree specimens were reinforced using seven \ncarbon-fiber mesh strands equally distanced, \nplaced at a 0.5 in depth from the bottom. This \nposition ensured the strands were working in \ntraction, simulating the stresses induced in the \ngunwales. The tests proved the efficiency of the \naddition of carbon fiber mesh strands in concrete \nsubmitted to tensile stresses. The strain-deflection \ngraphic shown on Figure 7 demonstrates a 40% \naugmentation in the absorbed energy compared to \nthe non-reinforced specimens. This increase is \nadequate for the gunwales as the cyclical stresses \ninduced by paddling generate an important amount \nof energy. Moreover, the samples showed micro-\ncracking, proving its capacity to distribute \nstresses.  This type of cracking allows the \noccurring of even greater deflections before \nrupturing. \nThe use of excess material from previous \nyears, the reduction of laboratory time required for"}

The team considered hull geometry \nand concrete properties during the design process to reduce total drag forces and maximize straight line \nspeed, while maintaining hull maneuverability and stability. Additionally, the team developed a \nreinforcement system that would provide sufficient capacity for all loading conditions. \nThe team began the design process by performing extensive research on canoe performance \ncharacteristics. The hydrodynamic forces of friction and wave drag create resistance to the motion of \nany vessel. While contact between water and the wetted surface area of a canoe creates frictional drag, \nwave drag increases exponentially with speed as more energy is required to force water aside          \n(Winters 2005). A longer canoe will reduce wave drag by matching the longer wave lengths generated \nat high speeds, but will also increase frictional drag with greater wetted surface area, resulting in an \noptimum length for a given speed. The maximum allowed length of 22 ft. is ideal for the competition.  \nThe team minimized drag forces by making minor adjustments to Dambitious (UNRCC 2013). The \ncanoe\u2019s design was selected for its effective straight-line speed and maneuverability. The design team \nused Nevada\u2019s advanced spreadsheet, Aqua-holic, to evaluate parameters impacting total drag forces \nsuch as the prismatic coefficient, length to beam ratio, and wetted \nsurface area. Eliminating 1 in. from the maximum beam decreased \nfriction due to a smaller wetted surface area. In addition, constructing \na wider bow bulkhead decreased wave drag. Modifying the bulkhead \nreduced the length of the canoe by 3 in. and aided the application of \nreinforcement. Although the broad bow created greater initial \nresistance to acceleration, the combination of adjustments decreased \ntotal drag during the canoe\u2019s top speed (Table 3). \nWhile modifications were made to the previous year\u2019s hull, \ncertain parameters contributing to speed and turning capacities \nwere maintained.

Due to a dynamic effect, all loading cases were increased by a \nrecommended value of 25 percent (Paradis and Gendron 2006). \nThe team modeled four different loading cases to determine the maximum positive and negative moment \nenvelope. The first two cases modeled a simply supported beam with the weight of the canoe considered \nwhile orientated both normally and inverted to represent the transportation and display. Finally, two and \nfour paddler cases were modeled as point loads using conservative estimates of 225 lbs for males and            \n150 lbs for females. Shear forces were found by summing canoe weight, buoyant force, and paddler load \nalong the length of the canoe and then integrated at 1 ft. intervals to develop a moment envelope       \n(Figure 4). As shown in the figure, the two paddler case with dynamic effects governs the maximum \nnegative moment and the simply supported case \ncontrols the positive moment. \nThe locations and weights of the paddlers, coupled \nwith the self-weight of the canoe and allowable stress \nlimits, required minimum concrete properties of 1,100 \npsi and 300 psi for compressive strength and MOR, \nrespectively.

Before conventional wet curing, the freshly \nplaced concrete was put in a CO2 rich environment for \ntwo hours \u2013 a technique called carbonation curing.  \n \nIn the early stages of curing, the calcium products \nof the mix are very reactive with carbon dioxide. \nCalcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) from portland cement \nhydration reacts with CO2 to form calcium carbonate \n(CaCO3), a binding product (Rostami et al. 2012). \nBecause CO2 reacts directly with Ca(OH)2, the addition \nof hydrated lime to the mix facilitated more reactions \nduring the carbonation curing process.  \nWith sufficient water replacement after the initial \ntwo-hour curing, carbonation cured samples reached \nnearly the same 28 day strengths as hydration cured \nsamples with the benefit of being more sustainable. \nPortland cement production is widely recognized as a \nmajor source of greenhouse gas CO2. For every ton of \nportland cement produced, nearly a ton of CO2 is \ngenerated (Kosmatka and Panarese 2011). When the \nreaction products form during carbonation curing, CO2 \nis permanently sequestered into the concrete. Unlike \nweathering carbonation, this process does not lower \ncompressive strengths or pH levels of the concrete and \noffers a way to mitigate a portion of CO2 emissions \nwithout any significant detriment to the concrete itself.  \nAnother benefit of carbonation curing is that the \nmicrostructure changes that occur in the concrete from \nthe reactions make the surface less permeable to water. \nAs the CO2 reacts and forms CaCO3, the reaction \nproducts precipitate to fill the pores of the concrete, \nspecifically near the surface (El-Hasaan et al. 2013). \nAbsorption"}

Obtaining feedback from last year\u2019s \npaddlers and using AcceleGator as a baseline, the \nteam focused on refining the hull for improved race \nperformance. Design goals were geared toward \nbalancing straight-line speed and maneuverability, \nwhile improving stability in order to accommodate \nthe kneeling paddling style.  \n    The design team sought to increase straight line \nspeed \nby \nreducing \nthe \nhull\u2019s \nwave-making \nresistance. This can be achieved by maximizing \nwaterline length; however, with the canoe length \nconstrained at 22 ft. (ASCE/NCCC 2015), other \nparameters had to be altered. The bow rocker was \ndecreased from 5.5 in. to 4 in. This decrease in \ncurvature reduced maneuverability which, in turn, \nincreased tracking. To compensate, the rocker \ncurvature was maintained along the hull bottom, \nproviding less lateral resistance and promoting \nboundary \nlayer \ncohesion. \nThis \ncombination \nmaintained \nsufficient \nmaneuverability \nwhile \nminimizing wave-making resistance (Winters 2006). \n    The continued use of a transom stern this year \nalso helped to maximize waterline length. This \ntruncation allows flow to continue as if the canoe \nactually extended out to a point as shown in Figure \n2. The increased effective waterline length results in \na \ndecrease \nin \nform \nresistance. \nProper separation \nwas \nachieved \nthrough \ncorrect \nsizing \nof \nthe \ntruncation \nby \nmaintaining \nthe \nFroude numbers \nof at least 2.0  \n(Maki et al. 2005).  \n    The ForeverGlades hull profile was flattened \nslightly, which enhanced the initial stability of the \ncanoe (Gullion 1994). The need for improved \nstability was expressed by paddlers in order to more \ncomfortably and effectively deliver power while \nkneeling. Wave-making resistance tends to increase \nwith a larger surface area; however, with a flatter \nbottom, the sanding process can be carried out more \naccurately, giving the hull a smoother finish and \nreducing friction drag when compared with \nAcceleGator (University of Florida (b) 2014). A 15 \ndegree raked bow, added for aesthetic purposes, \ndecreased the amount of deadwood in the bow, \nfurther reducing wetted surface area and friction \ndrag. From previous years\u2019 scale model test data, \nthis bow angle was determined to be the most \nefficient (University of Florida 2007).  \n    Hulls \nwere \ndesigned \nusing \nFREE!ship \n(Timoshenko 2013) and compared using the fluid \ndynamics program, Mitchlet (Lazauskas 2013). This \nwas done to accurately determine the designs with \nthe least wave resistance. Resistance was analyzed \nfor hull speeds ranging from 1 to 6 knots (1.69 to \n10.12 ft./s), the estimated maximum speed during \nthe co-ed sprint race. From these results, 4 final \ndesigns were tested for straight-line speed and \nmaneuverability. Scale models at 1:6 size were \nmilled using a computer numerical controlled (CNC) \nmachine at an on-campus fabrication center. This \nscale was chosen to best maintain model similitude, \nmatching Froude numbers while remaining in an \nacceptable range of Reynolds number.  \n    Based on design criteria and scale model test \nperformance which balanced speed and turning, a \nfinal hull was selected with a shallow arch bottom, \n22-ft. length, 26-in. beam, and 2-in. transom stern. \nForeverGlades improves upon last year\u2019s straight-\nline speed while maintaining comparable turning \nability and meeting all design goals."}

Once \ncomplete, carbon fiber mesh was placed over the \nentire canoe and embedded into the first layer by \nhand. The next layer was also applied at 1/8 in., \nafter which a second sheet of carbon fiber was \nembedded into the canoe. Layer thickness was \ncarefully monitored at the gunwale lip.  \n    A thicker, final layer was applied at 3/16 in. to \nallow the team to more effectively sand away \nexterior imperfections while maintaining the final \nthickness of 3/8 in.

Ska\u2019ana Specifications \nThe origin of the Orca whale embodies a legend of sustainability for the native \nHaida people of the Pacific Northwest. The story begins with a man who raises \ntwo wolf pups he finds on a beach. Once grown, the wolves swim into the ocean \ndaily to hunt whales for food. Each day the wolves would hunt, accumulating \nfar too much food. The Great Above Person saw this wastefulness and punished \nthe wolves by creating a fog while they were hunting at sea, rendering them \nunable to hunt or return to the shore.

The cube failure planes can be seen \nin Figure 12.

In addition to concrete tests, samples of the 0.125 inch steel wire \nrope were also tested in tension to verify the strength of the cable and crimped \naluminum ferrules (Figure 12).

Elemix was included in the lightweight mix because \nof its extremely low specific gravity of 0.04, but excluded from all other \nmixes due to its low strength for the structural mix and its visibility for the \ninlay and patching mixes. Additionally, the lightweight mix features 8 mm \nchopped fiberglass fibers for improved durability of the lightweight cellular \nstructure (UW, 2014). The aggregate gradation was refined from previous years to fit a transformed Fuller\u2019s \nCurve with the typical assumed exponent of n = 0.5 (Shakhmenko). This new gradation was very effective and \nled to an approximately 7% increase in the 7-day strength-specific gravity ratio of the structural mix and \nsignificant reductions in the density of the lightweight mix due to higher Elemix proportioning. \n \nMany admixtures were maintained from the 2014 design: Daraweld C latex polymer was used in all mixes to \nimprove bonding between concrete layers and improve tensile strength, Daravair 1000 liquid air-entrainer was \nused in the structural mix, while Rheocell 30 liquid foaming agent was used in the lightweight mix to achieve \nextremely high air contents. No air-entraining admixtures were used in either the patching or inlay mixes in \norder to facilitate a smooth exterior for reduced drag and aesthetic appeal. One major change from previous \nyears is the addition of Rheobuild 1000, a high range water reducer, into the structural, inlay, and lightweight \nmixes. The additional workability provided by a high range water reducer is generally used to create low water-\ncement ratio mixes with high strengths. However, in this application, the reducer was used to lower the paste \ncontent and reach lower densities while maintaining most of the strength and workability. An undesirable side \neffect of the high range water reducer was faster slump loss for the mixtures. The slump loss issues were \nmitigated with increased focus on faster concrete placing by training team members before canoe placing. Also, \nto account for slump loss issues the slump of the lightweight mix was vastly decreased from previous years \nwhich expedited placement of layers with a precise thickness.  \n \nFrom experience with the composite design, lower paste contents would \ndecrease the layer bond strength. To offset these negative effects, latex \ndosage of the lightweight mix was increased.

Mixes with \nPortland cement, Class C and F fly ash, and \nsilica fume were examined qualitatively \nbased on water demand, set time, and color. \nA baseline mix with only Portland cement \nwas made in order to make qualitative \ncomparisons. Mixes with silica fume had a \nrelatively high water demand and therefore \nwere eliminated. Mixes made with Class C \nand F fly ash had only a slight increase in \nwater demand and had adequate set times. \nParticle sizes were also examined (Figure 4) \nand a finely ground Class F fly ash, Micron3, \nachieved a significant increase of strength as \ncompared to normal size fly ash. In addition, \nthe color of the Class F fly ash mix was more \ndesirable and thus was chosen as the binder \ncomplement to the Portland cement. \n \nPhase II \u2013 Aggregates \n \n Now that 3CT had a general idea of \nthe binder makeup, various aggregates and \nblends were examined. 3CT looked at \nexpanded shale, vermiculite, glass beads, \nglass \nmicrospheres, \nand \nPoraver. \nVermiculite was eliminated quickly due to an \ninconsistent makeup and extreme water \ndemand. Glass beads produced mixes with \nthe highest compressive strength and gave \nthe concrete a glittery appearance. However, \nthe glass beads also produced the densest \nmixes and were therefore eliminated. From \nprevious years, it was known that a mix of \nexpanded shale could not be made to have a \nunit weight less than water. Therefore, \nvarious blends of expanded shale and \nPoraver were tested to find a mix that had a \nunit weight less than water. In addition, \nseveral mixes were made with just Poraver \nto compare with the blend mixes. It was \nfound that the blend mixes were stronger \nthan the all-Poraver mixes. However, the \nconcrete was difficult to sand. Therefore, the \nall-Poraver mix was chosen because its \ncompressive strength was still greater than \n1500 psi, and it sanded smoothly. \n \nPhase III \u2013 Water \n \nDue to the restriction of the water to \ncementitious ratio, this phase of research \nproceeded quickly. Water to cementitious \nratios ranging from 0.3 to 0.39 were tested \nfor workability and strength. The maximum \nstrength \nwas \nfound \nat \na \nwater \nto \ncementitious \nratio \nof \n0.33. \nHowever, \nworkability was extremely poor.

Because \nworkability is crucial to proper placement, a \nwater to cementitious ratio of 0.39 was \nchosen. \n \nPhase IV \u2013 Admixtures \n \n3CT researched various admixtures to \nfine tune the properties of the mix.

It was determined that the \nmesh reinforcement used had a low bonding \nstrength with the concrete. This year, 3CT \nlooked at various reinforcement meshes that \nhad surface features that promoted good \nadhesion to the mix. Meshes of Technora\u00ae, \ncarbon fiber, fiberglass, and a hybrid \nKevlar\u00ae/fiberglass were tested for tensile \nstrength and modulus of elasticity (Table 3). \nThe hybrid mesh was eliminated \nbecause it did not exceed 20% open area. \nCarbon fiber meshes were unusable due to \nstiffness.

The sections were glued together \nand their corners were sanded off to create the shape of the canoe. A second hotwire \nwas shaped from a stiff wire into an aesthetic shape with an area of 0.5 in2 to cut four \nribs in the form. The mold was fiberglassed to reinforce it for prestressing and to \nallow reuse if a second pour became necessary. To protect the polystyrene from the \nfiberglass resin, four layers of Kilz\u00ae primer were applied before fiberglassing. A gel \ncoat was applied and sanded to a smooth finish. Finally, the form was cut into five \nsections, with a key in the center that allowed the sides \nto fold in for easy extraction after curing (Figure 6). \n \nReinforcement began with eight \n1/16\u201d diameter \ngalvanized steel cables set at a height of 3/16\u201d off the form. Grade screws \nwere drilled into the form to a height of 1/2\u201d at intervals along each tendon \n(Figure 7); the tendons were tied to the screws with stainless steel wire to \ncontrol height. A layer of epoxy-coated carbon fiber scrim was tied tightly \nto the tendons for spacing consistency. A second layer of eight tendons \nwas then placed 3/8\u201d off the form, and carbon fiber scrim was tied to these \ntendons to create a spaced, double layered reinforcement profile. The cables in each layer were pre-\ntensioned to 300 lbs at the gunwale, 200 lbs at the chines, and 160 lbs near the keel. Each tendon was \nmonitored with steel springs (Figure 8); the length of each spring was \nprecisely measured with calipers, and the prestress force was calculated from \nthe spring constant. The carbon fiber scrim was heated to provide greater \nflexibility when wrapped around sharp curves in the form such as the chines.  \nA flexible 1/2\u201d galvanized steel mesh was used as reinforcement in the bow \nand stern instead of carbon fiber scrim due to the sharp keel at these locations. \n \nThe mix team pre-weighed dry mix materials prior to pour day to ensure \nconsistency and speed during concrete placement. Concrete was pushed \nthrough the reinforcement, hand packed, and continually checked for \ncompaction and depth (Figure 7). Placement started at the gunwale of the bow \nand proceeded upward and toward the stern for uniformity. The concrete was finished with vibrating \ntrowels, an innovation of the 2006 team, and the grade screws were temporarily left in the form to give \nprecise \u00bd\u201d depth during troweling and sanding. After the pour, the canoe was placed under sheets and a \nVisquine\u00ae tarp and wetted four times per day to provide hydration during curing. Wet sanding on the \ncanoe\u2019s exterior began after seven days. After a 13-day cure period the grade screws were removed, the \nprestressing tendons were released, and concrete was placed over the exposed ends of the tendons. After \n14 additional days of curing the fiberglass form was removed, and patching and sanding continued on \nboth the interior and exterior of the canoe until it was free of surface irregularities and sanded with up to \na 400-grit paper.
